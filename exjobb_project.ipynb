      "The Harry Potter series is a fantasy novel series written by J.K. Rowling, which started being published in 1997 and ended in 2007. The books have been incredibly successful, with translations into 73 languages and over 450 million copies sold worldwide. The Swedish translations were done by Lena Fries-Gedin. The series has also been adapted into films, starring Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, with the first film released in 2001. The books have received praise for inspiring many children to read and criticism from some religious groups who believe they promote witchcraft. The name Harry became more popular in Sweden during the 2000s, possibly due to the series' popularity. There are seven books in the series: \"Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone\", \"Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets\", \"Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban\", \"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\", \"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\", \"Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince\", and \"Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows\". The books follow the story of Harry Potter, a young wizard who discovers his true identity and enrolls in Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. J.K. Rowling is known for her ability to create complex plots and characters that readers can relate to.\n"
