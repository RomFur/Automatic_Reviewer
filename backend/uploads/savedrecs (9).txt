AB In present paper we would like to share some experiences of building new education in Sports Technology at Mid Sweden University and the results of 10 years of successfully running it in Ostersund. The Sports Technology education at Mid Sweden University started at Campus Ostersund in 2003 as a part of the curriculum of the Engineering Department. This specialization was initially at the three-year Bachelor level, and later it was extended to an additional two-year Master level. Aiming at the quality of Sports Technology education, three keystones are underlying its process, representing the solid knowledge base, capacity to be flexible in problem solving and the use an innovative approaches. The Department unites researches with a background in both natural sciences and engineering disciplines, having a wide experience of working with and within the industry, equally active in research and teaching. The unique constellation of the profiles forming the Department include not only the SportsTech (R) group, being "the backbone", but also the Ecology and Eco-technology, and Quality Technology groups bringing the excellence and extra competence needed to assure the quality of the Sports Technology education. We were the first higher education institution in Sweden to give this kind of education program and now some other Swedish Universities have followed us. Our success can be measured by a number of graduates taking good jobs in the industry. We also enjoy a steady flow of new students coming from all parts of Sweden, and Sports Technology education stays among the most desirable ones in the country. (C) 2013 The Authors.

AB Purpose The development of wearable technology has significantly changed the way people participate in physical activities. The purpose of this paper is to segment users of sports wearable devices based on technology readiness (TR). Design/methodology/approach Participants comprised a convenience sample of 356 participants using sports wearable devices in South Korea. Cluster analysis was performed to identify clusters of sports wearable users based on their TR (i.e. motivating and inhibiting beliefs regarding technologies). Analysis of variance andpost hocTukey's test were used to determine whether there were significant differences among the clusters. Findings Clustering identified three groups of users of sports wearable devices: Explorers (high motivation, low inhibition), Laggards (low motivation, high inhibition) and Pioneers (high motivation, high inhibition). Each group demonstrated significant differences in TR (i.e. optimism, innovativeness, discomfort and insecurity). It also found that Laggards are more likely to be female and older users (i.e. over 40 years old). Originality/value This study explores characteristics of possible market segments and provides a better understanding of user profiles of sports wearable devices. These findings provide insightful implications for marketers of sports wearable devices, who can tailor marketing strategies to each segment. Designers of sports wearable devices can benefit from the user profiles and develop more appropriate products for users.

AB Though motion posture correction technology based on the computer vision technology has been developed to decrease the loss from sports injury, there still exists some weakness. The joint movement of the same athlete varies in different sports program. Under high movement speed, the angle changes of joints are relevant to the motion effects, but it is difficult to measure the subtle changes with constraint models or methods. The traditional identification methods include the Factorization method and skeletal model method, both of which use the stable constraints model to analyze the motion parameters, so they cannot analyze motion parameters in the small-scale areas or effectively measure the subtle movement of the athlete motion posture parameters. To address these issues, this paper presents a new method to measure the 3D motion posture of the athletes. Through the simulation experiments, it has been proved that this method is able to measure the 3D motion parameters of athletes accurately and has a high application

TI A Narrative Review of the Link between Sport and Technology
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Background: Research on the application of technology in sports in Romania is completely lacking, and the existing studies at the international level have mainly been carried out in recent years. We considered it appropriate to highlight the best practice models of technology application in sports that can be multiplied, adapted, improved, and widely used. The paper aims to identify the use of technology and devices in sports, with an emphasis on their role in training and competitions with the aim of improving sports performance, to provide sports specialists, organizations, and authorities with a wide range of information regarding the connection between sport and technology. The results obtained regarding the application of technology in sports refer mainly to the following: techniques and technologies used in training and competition (portable localization technology and global positioning systems (GPS); Virtual Reality (VR) technology; video analysis; digital technologies integrated into sports training); aspects of sports training targeted through the use of technology (use of technology for athlete health, recovery, and injury management; use of technology for monitoring sports performance and various body indicators); training optimization and ecological dynamics and the sustainable development of sports. Conclusions: Unitary research, at a European or even global level, in a uniform theoretical and practical framework, could lead to much more efficient training with large increases in sports performance. The coaches and specialists working with the athlete determine the specificity of some elements of the training, depending on the characteristics of each athlete. Large clubs could become a factor in generating and disseminating knowledge related to training and competition monitoring, sports performance enhancement, and health, recovery, and injury management. Research directions for the use of technology in sport and the formation of connections with other fields can be extended. For example, combined technologies assisted by specialized software can be used. Creativity must be the starting point for the use and combination of existing technologies in sports and for the creation of new ones. Their creation and use involve the teamwork of athletes, coaches, and specialists from different fields, such as sports, physiology, psychology, biomechanics, informatics, etc.

TI The impact of technology on sports - A prospective study
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB Rapid technological progress and digitalization have considerably changed the role of technology in sports in the past two decades. As the human limits of performance have been reached in many disciplines, reaching future limits will increasingly depend on technology. While this represents progress in how athletes train and compete, similar developments await sports managers in the way they lead sports organizations and sports consumers in the way they consume and engage with sports. Using the SportsTech Matrix (i.e., a framework to capture how different types of technologies provide solutions to different user groups in sports), we examine how technology will impact sports in the future. We present a Delphi-based prospective study with quantitative and qualitative assessments from 92 subject matter experts for six future projections and 35 non-Delphi prospective survey items. We find that, by 2030, technology will significantly impact all three user groups in sports: athletes, consumers, and managers. For athletes, experts anticipate technology to play a major role for sporting performance improvements. For consumers, the consumption of sports content will continue to change significantly. For management, new types of manager profiles in terms of backgrounds and skill sets would be desirable. We discuss two possible future scenarios: (1) a probable future and (2) a game changer. Our findings should provide relevant insights for decision-makers and other stakeholders in sports and raise promising directions for future research.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPORTS MARKETING & SPONSORSHIP
AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is to investigate consumers' acceptance and use of sports and fitness wearable devices based on technology readiness (TR). In addition, the technology readiness and acceptance model (TRAM) will be used to investigate consumers' intention to use sports wearable devices (for simplicity, sports wearable devices will be simplified to the term sports wearables).
   Design/methodology/approach Convenience sampling was conducted from Korean consumers (n=247). Data were analyzed by partial least squares-structural equation modeling using SmartPLS 3.0.
   Findings The results found that positive TR has a positive influence on perceived ease of use (PEOU) and perceived usefulness (PU), and negative TR had a negative influence on PEOU and PU. PEOU had a positive influence on perceived usefulness (PU). Both PEOU and PU led to intention to use sports wearable devices. Also, the multi-group analysis found a positive correlation between TR and PEOU for especially male users.
   Originality/value The findings of this study provide a better understanding of consumers' behavioral intent to use sports wearables. Particularly, it also provides evidence that the TRAM is an appropriate framework for predicting users' intention to use sports wearables. This study also stresses the important role of TR in consumers' psychological processes leading up to the actual use of novel sports wearables.

   motivation, sports type and context-aware characteristics
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPORTS MARKETING & SPONSORSHIP
AB Purpose This study explores the drivers behind sports technology use and identifies the need for a new conceptualization of sports technology adoption. To address this issue, the authors create a new construct, "context-awareness," with four dimensions: tracking, coaching, sharing and gamification. Design/methodology/approach The paper uses a mixed-method approach, including in-depth interviews and partial least squares structural equation modeling. The proposed model combines technology acceptance frameworks with the Sports Motivation Scale and a novel context-awareness scale. It is empirically tested with a diverse sample of 600 respondents to identify use-intention differences according to sports motivation and sport types. Findings The paper reveals group differences in sports type (dynamic vs nondynamic) and sports motivation (intrinsic vs extrinsic) regarding sports technology use. It also suggests that perceived technology characteristics mediate the relationship between context-aware features and intention to use. Originality/value This research introduces a new construct of "context-awareness" into the literature on new technology acceptance. The proposed model combines insights from information systems, sports science, sports marketing and sports medicine to explain the adoption of complex technology.

TI The "Clockwork" Model for Deployment Technology Innovations in Sports
   Industry Ecosystem: Holistic Approach
SO SOCIETIES
AB The use of technology in different aspects of the sports industry is widespread across the world, affecting sports training, performance, judging, and spectating. However, the integration, deployment, and evolution of technologies in the sports industry ecosystem are still unclear and unexplained. In this paper, we aim to build and explain the conceptual model for deployment technologies in the sports ecosystem in a holistic approach. This conceptual model is based on a literature review and theoretical synthesis, coupled with 15 qualitative unstructured interviews with high-profile sport and technology experts. Then, we formulated 4 hypotheses and confirmed them using 15 qualitative unstructured interviews with technology and sports experts. The in-depth analysis of the literature and collected data let us build the "Clockwork" Model. To better visualize and explain the development of the model of deployment technologies in the sports ecosystem, based on the analysis of theoretical and empirical data, we compare the mechanism of the model with clockwork. Technology deployment is a complicated operational process and involves the continuous sequence of consecutive elements (stages), ideally functioning as a mechanism. Together, the hypotheses underscore the symbiotic relationship between traditional sports infrastructure and technological advancements, highlighting the importance of a balanced and well-functioning ecosystem for overall success and development in the sports industry. All four hypotheses were confirmed during the second set of interviews (N = 15). Furthermore, their synthesis brought us to build and refine the "Clockwork" conceptual model, which explains, articulates, and visually demonstrates the process of how technology innovations appear and evolve in the sports ecosystem; in other words, the continuous and cyclic process of technology implementation and deployment.

The examination was conducted through series of interviews (n=36) and a review of the literature to gain understandings from three areas: (1) Professional players and coaches of professional players (2) Amateur players and coaches at amateur levels and (3) Spectators. The findings presented that players at the professional level are using various technologies such as GPS vests to manage workload and reduce risk of injury. With amateur level sport, technologies are not as prevalent and the possible introduction of technology was surprisingly not considered as imperative. Spectators, in general, considered that the introduction of technologies changed the dimensions of their involvement positively and negatively. The findings provide a basis for further studies and possible trials with additional technologies to further assist the athlete and coaches and innovatively enhance the spectator's experience.

AB PurposeNotwithstanding the dynamics of digital transformation and its relevance for revenue generation in the entertainment industry, empirical research that focused on consumer behavior at the intersection of sport content and media technology acceptance is limited. Virtual reality (VR) is a re-emerging and nowadays commercially available technology that impacts sport consumed through media. The purpose of this paper is to investigate the consumer acceptance of VR technology and highlight the effects of content quality and flow experience as influencing factors of behavioral intention.Design/methodology/approachBased on a literature review, the authors constructed and empirically tested a model that extends the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (UTAUT2) by considering additional antecedent factors. Participants (N=570) in the empirical study viewed sport content via VR technology (Sport VR) and completed a survey before and after viewing. The authors conducted factor analysis and structural equation modeling.FindingsThree UTAUT2 influencing factors, i.e., performance expectancy, social influence and hedonic motivation, showed significant effects. Furthermore, flow and content quality had positive indirect effects. Thus, the quality of sport content and the state of flow that users experience when immersed in a VR environment are relevant factors that determine the performance expectations of consumers and their Sport VR usage intention.Originality/valueThis empirical study contributes to knowledge on consumer acceptance of a hedonic technology in a sport media context. Moreover, two factors extended the established UTAUT2 model.

On the one hand, it not only improved competitive sports continuously created new sport items, but also improved the training equipment and training environment, promoted the movement technology and changed the sport values. On the other hand, modem technologies also contributed to the alienation of technology, and weakened the physical fitness activities, and lead competitive sports into deformity errors, which made fair competition become empty, and generated a series of uncivilized unfair social problems. Therefore, we appeal of positive effect of modern technology. In the same time, confront and suppress its negative effects, to ensure that competitive sports may develop in healthy environment under the conditions of modern science and technology.

AB In recent years, technology has enabled sporting organisations to become innovators in the global sports arena. Elite sporting teams and bodies are becoming increasingly dependant on technology for daily operations and subsequently these organisations are more and more reliant on technological developments in sport. Player training and management technologies and team performance tools have given sporting organizations the avenues to become more competitive. Organizations invest in information technology for many reasons, for example cutting costs, increase in production and services without increasing costs, improving the quality of services or products and sporting organizations and bodies are no different in looking to technology to gain competitive edges as well as improvement of athlete preparation. However, in spite of these innovations and the potential to gain competitive edges, some seem to. struggle with technology resulting in an ambiguous and sometimes negative perceptions of IT services. This work examines the building of credibility in sporting organizations through education and the development of positive perceptions of information technology. The findings provide a basis for further studies and possible trials of differing education formats in technology to further develop both the positive acceptance of sports related technologies and assist in improving the sporting organization's environment.

AB The use of special mechanical egrogenic aids in sport is based not only on the applied physical laws, but on the contemporary technologies of sports training as well. To enhance sports performance in athletes, specialists simultaneously apply the knowledge of gravitation forces, laws of resistance and inertia, they consider the biomechanical features of the human motion system and tactical-technical peculiarities of competitive and training processes. To distinguish different trends in using mechanical egrogenic aids in sport, one should know the peculiarities of the spatial body orientation according to different coordination systems and also the underlying reasons, resulting in certain types of human movements. Such reasons, as we know, are different forces in their interaction - forces of resistance, resilience, friction, gravitation and other. Analyzing certain types of movement in athletes, one should know the arrangement peculiarities of numerous anatomic levers and the features of skeletal muscles work. Developing modern biomechanical technologies, as a rule, specialists pay much attention to constructing and advancing sports clothing and equipment, gravitational biomechanical stimulators, devices and sports vehicles. All the modern egrogenic aids normally also get "armed" with advanced computer software and automated monitoring systems, which allow to process large amounts of information, locating optimal and rational subsystems. Within the last twenty years specialists from all over the world have been researching optimal ways of developing mechanical ergogenic aids enhancing sports performance.

TI The controversy of sports technology: a systematic review
SO SPRINGERPLUS
AB Changes or introductions of technology or equipment can affect how a sport is played or influence its performances. This article conducted a systematic review of peer-reviewed literature to identify any case studies of controversial events surrounding the implementation or use of sports technology. 56 articles were identified that highlighted 31 different case studies found over a three decade time period. Thematic analysis revealed six distinctive themes when reviewing the articles. Whilst the sport of golf had the highest number of case studies, it was found that a significant level of attention had been recorded in the cases of Oscar Pistorius use of prosthetic legs in athletics and the use of full length swimsuits in swimming. The trend surrounding the number of articles was shown to be initially intermittent but saw a peak period from 2008 to 2010. However, the frequency of such articles since this peak has been more consistent. It is proposed that long periods of time without intervention or resolution by a governing body often increases the peer-reviewed attention paid to such cases in examples such as those identified in this systematic review.

The purpose of this study is to identify distinct profiles of Zwift users based on indicators of technology acceptance. Latent profile analysis (n = 877) identified three distinct latent profiles representing subgroups characterized by moderate, high and very high acceptance indicators. Results of the multinomial regression show that individuals with higher perceptions of the basic psychological need for autonomy and relatedness as well as individuals with high data privacy perceptions are more likely to be classified in the very high and high acceptance profiles than in the moderate acceptance profile. The results also show that older individuals are more likely to be classified in the moderate acceptance profile than in the very high acceptance profile even though odds ratio is rather low. The high and very high acceptance profiles also show higher behavioural intention to use Zwift in the future than the moderate acceptance profile.

AB The use of mobile technology, such as sports bracelets, is gaining popularity as it modifies the ways and processes of learning and teaching in college physical education (PE). However, little empirical evidence can be seen in literature to demonstrate crucial factors that influence university students' acceptance of sports bracelets. Guided by the technology acceptance model (TAM), this study hence aimed at explaining university students' intention to use sports bracelets. In total, 445 university students in China responded to a 19-item survey package. Results indicated that users' attitudes toward technology and perceived usefulness were significant predictors of intention to use sports bracelets. Meanwhile, users' intrinsic sports motivation significantly promoted users' positive attitudes toward this technology and was significantly influenced by perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. Overall, our findings highlighted the importance of stimulating young adults' intrinsic sports motivation that facilitates their intention to use sports bracelets such that to develop a healthy lifestyle that benefits their physical health.

This short paper will provide examples of a different approach to research in sports combined with technology. Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden has for the last few years become engaged into research using sports as an application area for applied research. The research efforts has utilised the way that sports are organised in Sweden, with the sports confederations and clubs providing the problem areas to base the research around. For the university several aspects have been key in the research efforts. Chalmers will not do research in sport science, but all researchers will stay in their respective area of expertise. This short paper will focus on how this approach strengthens our research in diverse areas such as the automotive industry (with examples from production logistics and crash safety) for the forest industry (composites and cellulose research) and astronomy. But they have now all been further developed by sports.

AB The present article analyses the effects of globalization and the influence of local cultures on the development and use of sports technologies, such as, for example, sailing boats, bicycles, skis, etc., and on market expansion in the commercialization of sports products. It is pointed out that only when there is a profound differentiation in a specific sports technology can the diversity of global and local effects become visible. Against the thesis of a world standardization of uniform goods and services and, therefore, of an evening up in the practice of sports, is the fact that with technological development the "degrees of liberty" increase enormously, opening up a practically inexhaustible space for individualization and adaptation to local cultures.

Sports equipment, which has developed from simple tools into complex extensions of the athlete, is at the center of this quest. Information technology is now driving innovation in sports equipment, with developments like computer-aided design and data analytics. Sports gear affects the athlete's mental state and is more than a physical accessory. This research investigates the integration of sport psychology and information technology in the design of sporting goods. It demonstrates how these seemingly unrelated fields work together to produce a comprehensive strategy that improves equipment performance and supports players' psychological well-being. The intersection of sport psychology and information technology is the basis of our investigation. Due to this synergy, technology can now collect and analyze information on athletic performance and psychological states. As a result, athletes and their gear have a close relationship since the equipment is tailored to each athlete's unique characteristics. By satisfying both physical and psychological requirements, this integration enables athletes to perform at previously unheard-of heights.

AB The main aim and focus of this work is to examine the technologies that are currently being used by some of the professional and Olympic sports, to assist referees in making the correct decisions. Five major sports in Australia were examined through discussion groups and interviews. The participants in the study had all officiated from the grassroots level to the elite level, using the technologies being adopted by their sport. The findings present that, in the majority of the examined sports, differing degrees of technology is being applied to aid in the decision making process. When used, technology does provide a mechanism to ensure the correctness of decisions. The success of the introduction of decision support technology is dependant on its usability, appropriate application and acceptance by the officials and participants of the match. The diligent use and application of appropriate technologies can be used as an effective aid to refereeing. Since the introduction of the use of technology to assist the referee, illegal play and tactics have been dramatically reduced and to a certain extent eliminated: subsequently these technologies have been a major contributor to the provision of a fairer platform for competition and led to improved player performance. The findings provide a basis for farther studies and possible trials with technologies to assist the referee in providing fair competition and to improve the quality of referees' decision making.

AB To improve performance on both individual and team levels, professional sports clubs increasingly follow the push for digitalization and adopt digital technologies. While the use of digital technologies is generally associated with great potential, we still know little about the realized value of these technologies. Against this backdrop, we investigated the implementation of a tracking technology in 13 German Handball-Bundesliga clubs to explore both the potential and realized values of such technology. We organized our study as an explorative, multiple case study and collected data by interviewing both clubs' representatives and the technology vendor. Initial results point to the realized value of tracking technologies deriving from several conversion contingencies. We contribute to the literature on information systems (IS) value creation in the context of professional sports organizations and offer initial empirical insights into the value realization process.

AB The present article analyses the effects of globalisation and the influence of local cultures on the development and use of sport technologies, such as, for example, sailing boats, bicycles, skis, etc., and on the expansion of commercialisation markets for sports articles. It is pointed out that, only when there is a profound differentiation in a specific sport technology can the diversity of global and local effects become visible. Against the thesis of a world standardisation of uniform goods and services and, therefore, of an evening up in the practice of sports, is the fact that with technological development the "degrees of liberty" increase enormously, opening up a practically inexhaustible space to individualisation and the capacity of adaptation to local cultures.

AB Phelps won eight gold medals in the 2008 Olympic Games, and won swimming championship five times in the World Championships in 2009, which turned high-tech swimsuits such as "Sharkskin-like" swimsuits into a focus of discussion. New technology, new materials and new process exert direct influence on the result of the competition. The fierce competition in sports among athletes has become the competition of countries and traders for benefits by using high technologies. FINA decided on 24, July, 2009 that high-tech swimsuits would be banned from international competition since 2010. In the paper, the alienation of competitive sports was rationally analyzed via the event of banning the "Sharkskin-like" swimsuits. According to the analysis results, the alienation of competitive sports was mainly manifested as misuse of illegal drugs, cheating for the athletes' eligibility to participate in competition, soccer fraud, and corrupt referee and so on, which violate the principles of fair competition in competitive sports and endanger the healthy development of competitive sports. Competitive sports was alienated for political, economical, individual subjective reasons and so on. Alienation of competitive sports was the alienation of human beings in substance. High technologies were just the propellants for alienation of competitive sports, which should be integrated with and jointly develop together with competitive sports.

SO SPORT BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to review the development and potential applications of emerging information and communication technologies (ICTs) in sports. The case studies are presented in details: computer system for tracking and visualisation in TV broadcasting and players/teams performance analysis in football. The paper concludes with the authors' opinion that future implementation of digital technologies, in the first instance, goal-line technologies, to support accurate, practical and reliable decision making in sports is highly needed and represent a basis for further increase in the commercial value of the pre-eminent global sport.
   Design/methodology/approach - The research utilised an exploratory approach to data gathering due to the fact that the topic is new and data are difficult to collect. The topic is analysed using case study method.
   Findings - The research found that there is an emerging market to extend the reach of digital technologies adapted for sports industry and sports events. Increasingly, developers are exploring and exploiting the vast potential of the ICTs to create value in the field of sports events. The development of emerging technologies create new opportunities that sports industry demands a growing range of innovative solutions for the purposes of decision making to be tested and accepted in the near future.
   Research limitations/implications - The research is based on data limitations related to the innovative ICT solutions, the rules of the game which significantly limit the scope for product innovation and a need to make a decision on application of an adequate solution within a short time period. In order to develop the extensive research results in the future, more information will be available after the termination of ongoing testing procedure.
   Practical implications - It is evident that digital video processing has found many applications in sports content analysis and TV broadcasting of competitive sports. The governing bodies should be aware of their role to support successful innovation which requires the coordinated action of all the actors who play vastly different roles in its commercialisation process.
   Originality/value - The paper emphasises how much technology has added to communication and economic potential of sports events, underlying that issue of video technology application to ease decision making in football is currently one of the most pressing matters due to constant arrival of new cases concerning "incorrect" decisions that add fuel to the controversy. The football authorities have finally recognised that the game has to be responsive to the concerns and suggestions of its customers.

AB The use of biomedical technology in sport: Are there any limits?
   In the article I examine the use of biomedical technology to enhance performance in competitive sport. More specifically I examine the possibilities for distinguishing between ethically acceptable and ethically unacceptable use of such technology. I criticize the World Antidoping Agency's (WADA) normative criterion for banning certain technologies as it is vague and unclear. I argue that any ban by WADA has to build on a clear and operational normative view of sport. Two relevant ideal-typical views are examined together with their technological implications. The narrow view is liberal and rejects restrictions on the use of biomedical technology among professional athletes as unjustifiable paternalism. The wider view implies a more restrictive approach and accepts certain regulations of performance-enhancing means and methods outside of competitions. In the conclusion, I compare the narrow and the wider views and reflect upon their possible status in competitive sport in the future.

   SPORTS ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, has accelerated technological immersion into society, economy and public administrations. The sports organisations are no strangers to this digitisation and must carry out their own digital transformation. However, investment in digital technology must be preceded by a diagnosis of the technological needs of each sports entity. Said mapping will help organisations know the most appropriate technological tools for their core businesses so they can properly design their digital transformation strategies. The objectives of this study were to design and create a tool to understand the digital structure of Spanish sports. The result has been the configuration of an instrument that includes the description of different technologies and different digital competencies specific to the sports industry, and which allows individuals to know the use, importance, perceived difficulty of use and economic accessibility of available technologies, as well as the degree of developed competency in the different sports organisations. It is concluded that the creation and application of a consultation instrument on digitalisation is the first and necessary step to carry out relevant, in-depth, valid and replicable research, which allows information to be gathered on the digitalisation needs of sports organisations to design their digital transformation roadmap and that the aids for digital transformation is distributed efficiently.

TI Information communication and technology in sports: a meticulous review
SO FRONTIERS IN SPORTS AND ACTIVE LIVING
AB IntroductionSports of all kinds even though have an alluring property of keeping their onlookers stuck to their place, the introduction of Technology, however, revolutionized it all together. Not only in legal sports but also the training and teaching methods have been reformed. The use of Information Communication and Technology (ICT) based technologies [Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Hawkeye, Computer vision, Artificial intelligence, etc.] has moderately increased the interactive nature of sports. Employing ICT-driven technologies have continuously been increasing performance levels due to which high effective performance levels have been achieved. In addition to offering information to the users, it also acts as a means for connecting and interacting with the remaining world. In this article, we provide a review of the studies considering the developments and impact of employing ICT technology on sports, especially cricket. The study has focussed on domain-specific developments in cricket sports: developments in the batting domain, bowling domain, and wicketkeeping as well. MethodsFor the study, the analysis has been done following the PRISMA guidelines. ResultsThe study found that even though the researchers have done justifiable work in employing technology in sports as a whole but the domain-specific contribution in sports like cricket is not at the level as is need of the hour. In addition to the mentioned domains in the study, the research should gain speed in other domains like domain-specific Talent Identification for both genders, different age groups, diverse sports, etc. Discussionundoubtedly, the sports domain is employing technology at a vast level but a few domains like sports talent identification especially related to the most famous games like cricket require an immediate and intense focus of the researchers. Since this domain is still carrying out a traditional coach-oriented approach. There is an acute need to revolutionize the domain by incorporating modern technologies into it.

TI Windsurfing's Rapid Global Diffusion: The Evolution of a 1970s
   Technology-First Sport
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF SPORT
AB There has been considerable academic interest in what has been variously labelled new, lifestyle or, as used here, technology-first sport. This category of participatory sport covers a wide range of activities - among them windsurfing. Like some other sports initially relying on the development of technological equipment, it spread across the world from California. Technology-first sport is positioned as a useful lens, and this is applied to windsurfing showing the value of exploring a sport's development from this perspective. Distinctive elements of windsurfing's early history are explored that relate to its rapid growth being intimately linked to technological evolution, intellectual property battles and globalisation processes. The genesis of the sport is contextualised in terms of favourable Californian circumstances and the trajectory of the American plastics industry at the time. Its diffusion across 1970s Europe featured intense technological and market competition which created a rapid evolution of the sport before consolidation. Distinct periods of evolution from 1970 to 1990 are evaluated. These include diffusion processes and the influence of national socio-political factors as it spread to Eastern Europe and to China. A final reflection of the present-day technology fragmentation of windsurfing further reinforces how use of a technology-first sport lens has value.

AB This study provides a comprehensive overview of blockchain applications in the sports industry through a systematic literature review (SLR) following PRISMA guidelines. The terms "Blockchain AND Sport" were used to search across databases such as Web of Science, Scopus, ScienceDirect, PubMed, Embase, IEEE, and Dimensions. After the search, 1,571 articles were identified, with 37 primary studies selected for detailed analysis. The review highlights blockchain's potential to transform the management and operation of sports-related activities by addressing challenges faced by stakeholders. The results demonstrated that blockchain enhances stakeholder trust through transparency, decentralization, and immutability. Its ability to automate processes like player transfers and contract management via smart contracts reduces costs and risks, while fan engagement is bolstered through digital tokens and NFTs. The findings underscore blockchain's capacity to revolutionize sports management through digital collectibles, secure transactions, performance optimization, and fan engagement through exclusive digital content. However, significant challenges still need to be addressed, including regulatory uncertainty, technical complexity, high implementation costs, and cultural resistance to decentralization. Despite these obstacles, blockchain presents substantial opportunities for innovation and efficiency in the sports industry. The review concludes that continued technological advancements, regulatory development, and cultural adaptation are essential for the widespread adoption of blockchain in sports.

This is understandable, considering the potential of AI applications in the sports industry, from improving the game, to engaging fans, to generating huge revenues through talent identification and recruitment. But AI also has a less attractive face, which can undermine the values of sport and even challenge its human nature. In this paper, I will briefly present both sides of the discussion around AI in sport, looking first at its potential benefits and then at the ethical challenges that this technology poses for the governance of sport. In between the pros and cons of AI in sport, I also offer a brief reflection on the question of sport as an essential human activity that AI is now seriously challenging.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ADVANCED COMPUTER SCIENCE AND APPLICATIONS
AB The emergence and extensive development and deployment of Industrial Revolution 4.0 have distinctly transformed the methodologies of sports performance monitoring. Consequently, there has been an increase in the emergence of new and adapted technologies in various areas of sports, such as competition analysis, player performance analysis and many others. There are rich and heterogeneous sports performance analysis technologies, algorithms and frameworks which provide constant basis for elevating new horizons of sports technologies. Thus, this paper aims to encompass significant findings that will provide a comprehensive survey in this area. Previous surveys have extensively focused on various methodologies of sports performance analysis, sport-specific analysis and other technology revolving around sports performance analysis. However, most of the focus is largely on training and competition performances and not off-field. The objective of this paper is to understand the current research trends, challenges and future directions of dynamically evolving technology embedded in the world of sports. This survey aims at contributing to this rich repository but with a new focus element of off-field that researches the connection between the athlete, the sports aspect of their life, the non-sport aspect and the methodologies of sports performance analysis. In addition, the exponential growth of Artificial Intelligence (AI) as a base for sports performance analysis systems and platforms is analysed extensively. This paper also presents a comprehensive classification of athlete performance analysis using algorithm tools and sports performance platforms and systems. Subsequently, the detailed analysis of this taxonomy has enabled the identification and detailed analysis of open issues and future directions.

AB Participation in individual or team-based sports provides everyone with the opportunity to learn and practice humanitarian attitudes and skills necessary for global citizenship. Sports by their nature present no economic, status, nationality, gender, or cultural barriers for participation. Sports facilitate personal health and wellness and a peaceful, diverse, tolerant, and understanding world for everyone regardless of circumstance. This is particularly the case for those who arc handicapped and those from isolated and/or economically challenged regions of the world. Sports participation has, for them, been the enabler of a better life, respect, and bringing hope through example to others facing seemingly unsurmountable difficult circumstances. In this report selected case studies of athletes and sporting organizations that through strength, courage and determination overcame barriers and achieved success benefiting humanity. Case studies of technology innovations that facilitate global participation by all peoples regardless of circumstance are discussed. For-profit and non-profit organizations are increasingly taking ownership of their social and humanitarian responsibility to make the world a better place through opportunity and sponsorship of sports for all. Public policy and applied technological research both have an important role to ensure the equitable and universal opportunity for participation regardless of circumstance.

TI Unnatural Technology in a "Natural" Practice? Human Nature and
   Performance-Enhancing Technology in Sport
SO PHILOSOPHIES
AB (1) Background: The World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) utilizes three criteria to include a technology in the List of Banned Substances and Methods-performance enhancement, health, and the spirit of sport. The latter is arguably the most fundamental one, as WADA justifies the anti-doping mission by appealing to it. (2) Method: Given the interrelationship among the notions of "human nature," "natural talent," and "sport," I investigate what view of human nature underpins the "spirit of sport" criterion. To do so, I focus on both WADA's official documents and scholarly formulations of the spirit of sport (that align with that of WADA). (3) Results: I show that the value attributed to excellence and effort in WADA's formulation of the "spirit of sport" criterion has its roots in the notion of human nature of the work ethic that resulted from the secularization of the Protestant ethic. (4) Conclusion: Drawing on my analysis of the "spirit of sport" criterion, I pose critical questions concerning the justification of WADA's anti-doping campaign and a tentative solution to move forward in the debate.

TI Sports game teaching and high precision sports training system based on
   virtual reality technology
SO ENTERTAINMENT COMPUTING
AB Sports can combine virtual reality technology with high-precision training to enhance the training effectiveness of users. In view of the current problems of insufficient physical quality and lack of exercise motivation faced by college students, this paper aims to explore a new type of college sports game teaching model through the integration of virtual reality technology. This is to improve students 'physical exercise efficiency and subjective initiative. This study constructed an experiential sports game model by applying posture recognition technology and fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method. The research indicated that the error accuracy with residual structure added will quickly decrease. When calculating the error, the overall error decreased by 6 mm. The proposed method can accurately distinguish human behavior in motion and trajectories in the motion area. The motion capture accuracy was high, and the deformation amount met the teaching needs of higher education institutions for sports game teaching. The contribution of this study is the significant improvement in the accuracy of motion capture, resulting in a total error reduction to 6 mm. This improvement ensured that the model can accurately distinguish between motion behavior and trajectory. The cumulative variance explanation rate of the scale reached 712.407 %, which was far more than that of the traditional model, and fully covered and explained the questionnaire information. Through the comparative test with four knowledge tracking models, the effectiveness and superiority of the sports game teaching mode integrated with virtual reality technology were verified.

TI From a Technology That Replaces Human Perception-Action to One That
   Expands It: Some Critiques of Current Technology Use in Sport
SO SPORTS MEDICINE-OPEN
AB Information technology has been integrated into most areas of sport, providing new insights, improving the efficiency of operational processes, and offering unique opportunities for exploration and inquiry. While acknowledging this positive impact, this paper explores whether sufficient consideration has been directed towards what technology risks detracting from the learning and developmental experiences of its users. Specifically, viewed through the philosophical lens of the device paradigm, and considering a more ecological account of technological implementation, we discuss how technology use in sport could subtly disengage educators and applied sports scientists from performance environments. Insights gleaned from such an ecological account of technology implementation could lead sports science and educational teams to ask and reflect on tough questions of current practice: i.e. has too much control been given to technological devices to 'solve' problems and communicate knowledge (about) in sport? Has technology improved the skills of players and performance staff? Or are performance staff at risk of becoming over-reliant on technology, and as a result, reducing the value of experiential knowledge (of) and intuition? Questions like these should be asked if technological devices, purported to support aspects of practice, are continually integrated into the sporting landscape.

TI Predicting Sports Injuries with Wearable Technology and Data Analysis
SO INFORMATION SYSTEMS FRONTIERS
AB Injuries resulting from sports and physical activities can be persistent and pose a substantial problem for player's economic wellbeing and quality of life. Wearable technologies in conjunction with analytics can help mitigate the risk to players by identifying injury risk factors and focusing on risk reduction. Prior to engaging in strenuous sport activities, wearables can be employed to facilitate the quantification of relevant functional capabilities, ultimately advancing the field of sports injury management. In this paper, we discuss how wearable technologies can improve the health and athletic performance of athletes by monitoring participants across many variables. A cohort of 54 army ROTC cadets participated in this study. Using Zephyr BioHarness Wearable technology, we gathered quantifiable data to generate insights that allow us to predict and prevent injuries related the wearer's physical exertion during sporting activities. This study finds that a combination of high BMI and high mechanical loads could result in injury. Therefore, in creating an exercise program, it is imperative to ensure that mechanical load is incrementally increased through the practice season as athletes become conditioned. While, a high level repetitious mechanical load with unconditioned athletes could cause injuries in short time, it is important to impose enough mechanical loads in the training program to ensure good musculoskeletal development. While our analyses identified several factors associated with injury data during ROTC activities, other wearable variables might become significant in other situations. In summary, results from this study demonstrate that wearable technology allows players with an increased risk of injury to be identified and targeted for intervention.

SO ANNALS OF APPLIED SPORT SCIENCE
AB Background. In recent decades, information technology has become a vital component of various aspects of our lives. The use of information technology in different domains has made the analysis of the level of its acceptance/rejection a significant factor in organizations. Objectives. The aim of this study was to illustrate the application of the extended technology acceptance model in sports organizations. Methods. The participants consisted of 350 employees selected from across various Iranian sports organizations. The data were collected according to the perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, attitude (AT), intention to use (IU), technology self-efficacy (TSE), technology anxiety, perceived enjoyment, and user satisfaction for each variable in the study model. A panel of experts determined the face and content validity of the experiment. The Cranach's alpha coefficient was used to determine the validity. Results. The results showed that AT, self-efficacy, PU, EOU, and user satisfaction have a meaningful effect on the intention to use information technology. The highest effect was related to AT, and the lowest to user satisfaction. Conclusion. It can be claimed that when people have a more positive AT toward the use of information technology, they will exhibit beliefs or excitements, which makes it more viable for them to perceive information technology positively, and consequently increase the intention to use it.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTER SCIENCE AND NETWORK SECURITY
AB Educational reform in Ukraine encourages the use of multimedia technologies in the training of specialists in Physical Education and Sports, which is one of the promising directions of education development. Therefore, the article specifies the content of the terms "innovation" and "technology". For modern society, the introduction of multimedia technologies in education is not so much theoretical as pragmatic, since under condition of globalization it concerns its historical development and prospects associated with the so-called "high technologies".Our goal is to improve the training of Physical Education and Sports specialists by means of multimedia technologies. All of innovative technologies can be divided into four groups, depending on the appropriate form of educational activity for their use. The development of multimedia technologies in the training of specialists in Physical Education and Sport at the present stage of education development should be carried out in accordance with the criteria of manufacturability, which are presented in the article: scientism, to rely on the theoretical provisions of pedagogical science and methods of teaching the discipline, socially recognized educational goals, prospects for modernization of Education; consistency, which provides for the interaction of parts and the whole in the organization of the study environment, as a result of which the physical development of the young generation is an integral entity; guarantee, that is, the error between the planned and obtained results should be minimal; manageability, that is, full management of the stages of work of the teacher and students, which make up the completed cycle of actions; mass participation, for the purpose of applying the technology does not depend on the physical training of students, the pedagogical skill of the teacher and the type of educational institutions. The article presents the theory and method of organizing sports events and circuses in the training of specialists in Physical Education and Sports by means of multimedia technologies. In order to increase the level of physical development of a person, physical fitness and the state of health of students, which has a clear trend to constant deterioration, it is necessary to instill love for sports, carry out high-quality training and organize sports events using multimedia technologies. In the process of sports activities, the participants' mental education is carried out. There are two types of communication here: direct and indirect, which are described in the article.In games and sports competitions, there are many opportunities for forming rules of collective behavior. The main issues of the organization of sports activities by means of multimedia technologies have been clarified. During sports competitions, the tasks presented in Physical Education and sports classes are improved, which ensure the improvement of physical and theoretical training of the individual. The pleasure of sports, bright, emotional spectacles, confirmed by multimedia technologies, arises from the participation of the viewer in them.

SO AGRO FOOD INDUSTRY HI-TECH
AB With the rapid development of computer technology, motion recognition technology has also been rapid development. At the site of the athlete's training, the coach needs to guide each of the players, however, due to the relatively fast speed of individual actions, it is difficult to distinguish with the naked eye, this requires a set of action recognition system to identify, which can be used as an important basis for athletes to improve action. In this paper, the technology of sports action recognition based on the somatosensory technology was studied; it was found that the algorithm and the extraction of the motion characteristics were very important, and then a set of action recognition system was established.

AB This investigation explores technology adoption among Canadian high-performance coaches and proposes a model that encompasses both the internal and external factors that influence how these coaches engage with new technology. The proposed model is a synthesis of two papers, one quantitative and the other qualitative, derived from the same study. Twenty-five current and retired Summer and Winter Canadian national team coaches participated in the study. In the quantitative part of the study, coaches completed four questionnaires: a general demographic form, the ATI, CSEM, and PRA/PCo Scales. Of these coaches, eleven agreed to be interviewed utilizing a semi- structured format, where qualitative data was collected. Using inductive and deductive analysis methods, eight thematic categories (factors) were identified. These thematic categories were then categorized as 'internal' and 'external' factors that affected technology adoption behaviour amongst elite sporting coaches. A proposed Technology Adoption Behaviour (TAB) Model was developed based on the eight thematic categories derived from the analysis. Technological proficiency, impact on athletes, and technology interaction are categorized as 'external' factors. 'Internal' factors encompass self-efficacy, organisational trust, and subjective norms/social influence. Because the challenges and advantages of technology adoption can involve both external and internal factors, they are presented as such in the model. The TAB model may be used in future studies to further investigate adoption behaviours among coaches. Elite sport offers unique challenges which are intrinsic to this field. The TAB Model offers a coach-centric view on relevant conditions that influence technology adoption behaviours and reveals barriers currently present in high performance sport. As depicted in the TAB model, the combination of internal and external factors may impact outcomes related to technology adoption.

AB The sports industry faces the challenge of digital transformation. However, the degree of digitalization and technological transformation of this industry is unknown. The aim of this study was to evaluate the perception of the use of digital technology, digital competences in European sports organizations and to understand their technological structure. Based on approaches from economic, organizational and management theory, a questionnaire was designed and administered to a sample of 569 managers of organizations from different sports modalities and European countries (Austria: 9.0%; Cyprus: 5.8%; Ireland and the United Kingdom: 8.8%; Italy: 9.7%; Portugal: 51.8%; Spain: 14.9%). A five-point Likert-type scale was used. The results showed that they practically do not use this technology (2.45), that 43.2% do not have technologies for data analysis and 48.85% for the evaluation of tactical technical physical performance. Furthermore, this is somewhat important (3.73), moderately complicated to use (3.05) and very expensive (2.79). Nor do they have very developed digital skills (2.95). This analysis highlights the need to implement digital organizational culture, planning investment strategies in digitalization and training in digital skills.

AB Wearable devices measuring some physical or physiological quantity of an individual have already become a part of daily life for many people. While such simple devices output mainly the statistical values of measured quantities or count events, demands in sport are more stringent. Quantities of interest must be measured in wider range, with greater precision, and with higher sampling frequency. We present a short introduction to motor learning in sport and its needs for technology back-up. We present properties and limitations of various sensors used for sport activity signal acquisition, means of communication, and properties and limitations of communication channels. We shed some light on the analysis of various aspects of sport activity signal and data processing. We present timing, spatial, and computational power constraints of processing. Attention is given also to the state of the art data processing techniques such as machine learning and data mining. In conclusion we present some technological trends and challenges in sport, such as Internet of Things, smart sport equipment, and real-time biofeedback systems and applications.

SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB The rapid uptake of digital technologies is constantly transforming the modern culture of sports spectating; however, relatively little is known about the impact of digitalization on the changing face of global sports-consuming audiences, particularly from a qualitative perspective. In this article, the relationship between modern mass digital technologies (i.e., mobile applications and big data) and audiences of sports spectators is described and explained by taking a customer-centric approach to grounded theory using a literature review and in-depth qualitative semi-structured interviews (N = 12) with sports marketing, management, and technology professionals. The qualitative approach permits the gathering of in-depth insights into a problem, generates new concepts through data synthesis and analysis, and captures changing attitudes within the sports industry. Moreover, the qualitative approach to research is not bound by the limitations of quantitative methods and focuses on the primary questions of "how " and "why " digital technology's mass deployment and diffusion have transformed content consumption in the sports industry. The analysis first systematizes and codes the collected data. Second, all the materials are iteratively read and the key points are outlined. Using the iterative analysis, the theoretical and empirical insights and findings are synthesized in order to achieve the results. Finally, dimensions of the transformation of sports spectators' consumption are identified and explained. The research implications highlight "how " and "why " modern digital technologies have changed the sports-consuming audience by making it more inclusive in terms of age, gender, demographics, social and health status. These findings are useful for sport managers to better understand their audiences and processes in an ever-changing global society.

AB Identifying tools and processes to effectively and efficiently evaluate technologies is an area of need for many sport stakeholders. This study aimed to develop a standardised, evidence-based framework to guide the evaluation of sports technologies. In developing the framework, a review of standards, guidelines and research into sports technology was conducted. Following this, 55 experts across the sports industry were presented with a draft framework for feedback. Following a two-round Delphi survey, the final framework consisted of 25 measurable features grouped under five quality pillars. These were 1) Quality Assurance & Measurement (Accuracy, Repeatability, Reproducibility, Specifications), 2) Established Benefit (Construct Validity, Concurrent Validity, Predictive Validity, Functionality), 3) Ethics & Security (Compliance, Privacy, Ownership, Safety, Transparency, Environmental Sustainability), 4) User Experience (Usability, Robustness, Data Representation, Customer Support & Training, Accessibility) & 5) Data Management (Data Standardisation, Interoperability, Maintainability, Scalability). The framework can be used to help design and refine sports technology in order to optimise quality and maintain industry standards, as well as guide purchasing decisions by organisations. It may also serve to create a common language for organisations, manufacturers, investors, and consumers to improve the efficiency of their decision-making relating to sports technology.

TI Enhancing on-pitch learning capabilities with data analytics and
   technologies in elite sports
SO EUROPEAN SPORT MANAGEMENT QUARTERLY
AB Research question: We have explored the utilisation of data analytics and technology in elite sports and the role it plays in enhancing on-pitch learning capabilities. In the competitive, complex, and dynamic professional sports environment, margins are small and critical for the success of a team or club. It is essential for sports organisations to keep learning individually and collectively to strengthen their ability to improve on-pitch. In this paper, we explore how data analytics and technology enable sports teams to develop learning organisation capabilities to add-value on-pitch by increasing their knowledge base.Research methods: Data for this study were gathered through 33 interviews with elite sport industry experts from football (Premier League, Championship), cricket (First Class County Clubs) and rugby (Rugby League). It includes seven sports directors, 12 managers and coaches, six players and former players, six performance analysts, one member of the medical staff, and one sports analytics academic.Results and findings: Our findings add to the understanding of players, coaches, and teams as learning entities, and discuss how they capture and transform data into knowledge with the use of data analytics and technology, which is then utilised to inform on-pitch practices and decision making. We provide a blueprint framework explaining how a sport club can add value on-pitch by achieving a learning organisation status, through the use of data analytics and technology.Implications: This paper contributes towards the continuing discourse regarding data analytics and technology utilisation within the sports industry, in the on-pitch domain. There has been limited academic research published to date on data analytics and technology use in professional sports, particularly with respect to investigating it from a learning organisation theory perspective.

TI The impact of technology on sporting performance in Olympic sports
SO JOURNAL OF SPORTS SCIENCES
AB To assess the effect of technology on sport, the performance statistics for four disciplines were analysed: the 100-m sprint, pole vault, javelin, and cycling. The concept of a performance improvement index was developed to allow comparison between athletes and between sports with a higher index indicating a greater improvement in the sport. The following performance improvement indices were found: 100-m sprint, 24% over 108 years; pole vault, 86% over 94 years; javelin, 95% over 76 years; 4-km individual pursuit, 35% over 32 years; one-hour cycling record, 221% over 111 years. Around 4% of the index for the sprint was attributed to tighter, aerodynamic clothing, suggesting that general athletic improvement in sprint-type events has been around 20%. Technological developments in simple equipment such as the pole vault or javelin were seen to affect the index by around 30%, while the index associated with aerodynamic improvements in the one-hour record was around 100%. It is concluded that the performance improvement index could be extended to amateur as well as elite sport where distance or time is used as a measure of performance.

TI Transforming sports training through the integration of internet
   technology and artificial intelligence
SO SOFT COMPUTING
AB The Internet of Things (IoT) has gained significant popularity through wearable technologies. Several IoT devices are used in educational institutions, smart homes, and security management. Their widespread use in sports training applications using IoT (WS-IoT)-based wearable sensors is noteworthy. Meanwhile, artificial intelligence (AI) has evolved rapidly, and its applications have expanded across many diverse fields. Over the past few years, China has placed greater emphasis on physical education to enhance students' physical fitness and overall capabilities. A significant number of colleges and universities have adopted artificial intelligence to transform traditional single-mode sports training methods. This paper introduces a continuous monitoring system for sports individuals using the WS-IoT. The goal of coaches is to maximize the results of athlete training across various sports events using AI technology and their sports expertise. In this study, we examine the use of AI technology in sports and assess the practical implications of its implementation. To achieve the objective function, we used a Bayesian deep classifier and deep learning algorithms that utilize adaptive optimization. Utilizing artificial intelligence in Chinese educational institutions improves training efficiency and effectiveness. The system was then rigorously tested and analyzed in terms of the quality-of-service parameters, including communication collisions and packet loss rates. It is shown that packet loss rates increase with increasing packet numbers, but collision rates remain unchanged. Furthermore, a practical application of the system in colleges and universities showed that 14.4% of the students were extremely satisfied with the use of teaching materials, 24.5% were satisfied with the materials, 30.1% were satisfied with the training methods, and 17.9% were dissatisfied.

TI Fault detection technology of national traditional sports equipment
   based on optical microscope imaging technology
SO ALEXANDRIA ENGINEERING JOURNAL
AB The safety of national traditional sports equipment is one of the basic conditions for the development of national traditional sports. Based on this, a fault detection technology of national traditional sports equipment based on optical microscope imaging technology is proposed. The concept of confocal fluorescence is integrated into the imaging system of an optical microscope to improve the axial resolution of optical microscope and enhance its microscopic imaging effect; the microscopic images of traditional national sports equipment are collected, and the mean filtering method is used to reduce the noise of the collected microscopic images of traditional national sports equipment, and the phase images after noise reduction are processed based on the error correction algorithm, the phase image after noise reduction is fused to build a fault free standard background image and calculate the gray mean value of all pixels in the micro image. If the gray value of the pixel is higher than the confidence interval, it is determined that there is a fault. The detection results show that the proposed method can effectively detect different types of fault information, achieve the expected goal of fault detection, and the average energy consumption in the detection process is about 0.47 J/s, which is lower than the other two technologies by more than 0.4 J/s, and the fault detection performance is good.

TI Applications of GPS Technologies to Field Sports
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPORTS PHYSIOLOGY AND PERFORMANCE
AB Global positioning system (GPS) technology was made possible after the invention of the atomic clock. The first suggestion that GPS could be used to assess the physical activity of humans followed some 40 y later. There was a rapid uptake of GPS technology, with the literature concentrating on validation studies and the measurement of steady-state movement. The first attempts were made to validate GPS for field sport applications in 2006. While GPS has been validated for applications for team sports, some doubts continue to exist on the appropriateness of GPS for measuring short high-velocity movements. Thus, GPS has been applied extensively in Australian football, cricket, hockey, rugby union and league, and soccer. There is extensive information on the activity profile of athletes from field sports in the literature stemming from GPS, and this includes total distance covered by players and distance in velocity bands. Global positioning systems have also been applied to detect fatigue in matches, identify periods of most intense play, different activity profiles by position, competition level, and sport. More recent research has integrated GPS data with the physical capacity or fitness test score of athletes, game-specific tasks, or tactical or strategic information. The future of GPS analysis will involve further miniaturization of devices, longer battery life, and integration of other inertial sensor data to more effectively quantify the effort of athletes.

AB Since the 20th century, the technology has developed rapidly and changed social life in all aspects; and simultaneously it also has profound influence on sports. For one thing, it promotes sports globalization, fairness and scientific process with better equipment, superior training way and more additional agents applied in sports; for the other, it challenges the spirit of sports in the following ways. First, doping, the twin brother of technology, destroys the body's health; second, technology disputes fairness; third, immeasurable technology departs from the Olympic spirit of being "swifter, higher, stronger", which should be honored as human vitality and sports ability and humanism. Technology, a sword with two blades to sports, should be based on humanism, that is, without prejudice to body health and human life. We should encourage high-tech to promote scientific, just and efficient process by forbidding the use of doping; and advice that the use of scientific aids should be based on principle of fairness, and that the improvement of equipment standards should be based on "humanistic principle". Only by doing so, can sports can be developed soundly

AB This paper proposes the concept of a maturity model for smart cities based on the deployment of sport-related technologies. The potential of sport as a catalyst for the development of smart cities is enormous and transversal: sport technological integrations in urban environments can enhance public health, community engagement, and environmental sustainability. The paper highlights innovative practices and proposes a framework for evaluation of smart cities maturity that incorporates sports facilities and technology. Our vision is grounded in the EU Expert Group's definition of sport and its broad social-economic impact in modern societies. To analyze and classify initiatives in sport and smart cities, we propose a framework based on nine functional domains of smart cities and five core technologies for sports and innovation. Sport has significant potential to drive smart city applications in various sectors. Moreover, sport and smart cities share common technological enablers like sensors, IoT, intelligent materials, big data analytics and artificial intelligence, fostering an environment leading to their convergence into an integrated ecosystem. Applying a simple classification of projects similar to the Software Capability Maturity Model, our aim is to provide a preliminary model for calculating the "distance" from the optimal use of sport in the various functional domains, thus providing indications about intervention areas to cities stakeholders.

SO SPORTS MEDICINE AND ARTHROSCOPY REVIEW
AB As adaptive sports grow in popularity, it is increasingly important to understand the injuries for which their athletes are at risk. This population is challenging to study given its small size and diversity of its participants; accordingly, research is mostly low quality because of limited sample sizes and study durations. Summer adaptive sports account for 22 of 28 Paralympic sports, with the most frequently studied being wheelchair basketball, rugby, tennis, athletics, swimming, and soccer. Injuries vary by sport because of differences in contact level, limbs utilized, and athlete impairments. Equipment changes and technological advances, especially within wheelchair and amputee sports, have increased the level of competition and reduced injury rates. Fortunately, the majority of injuries across adaptive sports are minor and do not result in significant time off from sport. Still, even minor injuries can negatively impact these athletes' mobility and activities of daily living compared to the nondisabled population.

AB In this essay some ideas are presented to analyze the incipient sportsmanship of video games and their entry into the sports arena, in relation to digital technology, to the body and to the production of a subjectivity in late modern society. Electronic sports or e-sports can be thought both as entertainment and body training, differently from other traditional sports. The organic body seems to have found its' great limitations, becoming more and more obsolete and outdated in the age of digital technology. Electronic sports, as practices and products of the cultural industry, are bound to social acceleration and must bet on the principles of faith in progress, updating, technologization, massiveness and spectacularization typical of the sports phenomenon. In this way, they seem to find their success and legitimacy in the new production of sensitivities that serve those of seduction and excitement of the senses, and that are determined to fight against boredom, upholding the individual's constant obligation to enjoyment. This short essay aims to establish some minimum theoretical coordinates, as well as possible empirical ways to explain how electronic sports work, which new elements they provide, and which are still mere reproduction of logics and senses previously investigated.

AB The communication with the fast pace of the network sports media can meet the public demands, but there appeared the unfavorable factors in the process of the propagation. With the use of the communication theories, from the perspective of the sociology, the author analyzes the problems in the dissemination of the network sports information. Form the results we can find that there are the cultural conflicts, the ethical loss and other problems in the dissemination process of the sports information. And in the face of the crisis of the network trust, we should actively put forward the ways to solve the problems, and improve the sense of the 'social responsibility of the network media. In this paper, from the analysis of the application background of the network technologies, combined with the specific mode and the connotation and characteristics of the communication of the sports information, through the integration of the new features of the transmission of the current sports information, the author explores the new dissemination model of the sports information based on the network technologies.
   The degree of the media concern on the sports events is high, and the sports events take the modem media means with the network communication as the carrier, which can realize the immediacy and timeliness of the dissemination and can accelerate the expansion of the dissemination and the influence of the sports events. But at the same time, it can also provide a platform for the dissemination of the information network of the public opinions of the sports events. In the real life, the formation and the change of the personal opinions and the formation and the change of the mainstream views are affected by the network to a certain extent. Especially in the era of the We-media, both the personal points of view and the spread of the network public opinions, to a certain extent, are affected by the structural system. The sports events are specially concerned by the society, and gather the focus of the society, which can become the social hot spots, and will be more likely to become the basis of the outbreak of the crisis of the public opinions. In the era of the structured media, the paths, width and depth of the propagation of the public opinions of the sports events have an important impact on the individuals who pay much attention to the events and the influence of the events.

TI Development and Practice of Sports-Related Public Welfare Platform Based
   on Multi-Sensor Technology
SO SENSORS
AB Today, more and more Internet public media platforms allowing people to make donations or seek help are being founded in China. However, there are few specialized sports-related public welfare platforms. In this paper, a sports-related public welfare platform that aims to help people who were disabled due to participation in sports and those who are disabled but want to participate in sports was developed based on multi-sensor technology. A multi-sensor data fusion algorithm was developed, and its estimation performance was verified by comparing it with the existing Kalman consistent filtering algorithm in terms of average estimation and average consistency errors. Experimental results prove that the speed of the data collection and analysis of the sports-related public welfare platform using the algorithm established in this paper was greatly improved. Relevant data on how users used this platform showed that various factors affected users' practical satisfaction with sports-related public welfare media platforms. It is suggested that a sports-related public welfare media platform should pay attention to the aid effect, and specific efforts should be devoted to improving the reliability and timeliness of public welfare aid information, and ensuring the stability of the platform system.

AB With the constant development of digital technology nowadays, architectural creation is undergoing great changes on design ideas and realization methods: With the international events held recent years, there comes more and more international design competition on large sports center, in which digital technology has become a major boost of design innovation. Meanwhile, digital design method has achieved a change from media reproduction to the body resulting. Based on the analysis of typical examples of large sports center design using digital technology, this paper makes a deep study of the application of digital technology in the international design competition of large sports center through digitized form, digital manufacturing and control processing.
   Over the years, large sports center international competition requires specific features such as mass body, complex body, regionality and so on. However, its gross amount of irregular shape always can not be accurately grasped by traditional software, and it is hard to solve multi-disciplinary problems with single software because of its complex type and its diverse design factors. However, in the context of the digital age, although sports architecture has large span, it also has strict form; although it has complex streamline, it also has clear function, all of which provide a good platform for the parameters on the application of digital technology in the sports center design. Logical relationship of form generation, many measurable parameters and multidisciplinary collaborative design have become the starting point that digital design integrates into traditional design logic. At the same time, digital software creates large span space which is different from the traditional one through its unique "script design", "set theory" and "shape linkage with parameter", which provide architects greater degree of design freedom. Furthermore, the architects could continuously adjust and optimize by regulating the parameters in the digital software system, finally making the sports architecture get valuable experience and rapid development in a rational state.

TI The Intention of Sports Participants to Utilize Digital Technology for
   Engagement: The Moderating Role of Self-Efficacy
SO BEHAVIORAL SCIENCES
AB Digital technology has greatly influenced the way the public engages in sports activities. However, the behavioral decision-making process associated with the adoption of digital technology for sports participation remains unclear. This study employs the Behavioral Reasoning Theory to elucidate the cognitive processes underlying participants' behavioral intentions by examining the reasons for and against the adoption, as well as the influence of self-efficacy. The model presented is a theoretical expansion of the current innovation frameworks within sports management and marketing. The findings indicate that the reasons against adoption by respondents exert a more substantial impact on their attitudes and behavioral intentions than the reasons for adoption. Perceived enjoyment and perceived barriers to use are identified as the leading factors for reasons in favor of and against adoption, respectively. The study also highlights the pivotal role of participants' self-efficacy in the cognitive decision-making process concerning the adoption of digital technology for sports participation. To amplify the impact of digital technology within the sports domain, it delineates the reasons for and against adoption and to account for the influence of self-efficacy in the decision-making process, thereby ensuring that the integration of digital technology with sports more effectively addresses the practical needs of participants.

AB Sports are the most important recreational activity. Sports are of many types. Some may be played individually, while some are played in teams. Every country wants to get fame at the global level in different sports. In order to achieve fame, countries are investing in sports and games to enhance the performance of their teams and players. Many people are involved in the analysis of the performances in a sport like notational analyst, who make strategies and tactics for a game; bio-mechanist, who takes the responsibility of fitness of players and tries to get extraordinary results; team managers and coaches. With the advent of machine learning in sports, there is a lot of improvement in the analysis of performances. In mere future, the teams may not have coaches to analyze their performances. In this paper, I am going to discuss about the analysis role of machine learning in the improvement of performances of players and the team in different sports and how the wearable technology helps the players to know their performance levels and further improvements

TI Disentangling assistive technology: exploring the experiences of
   athletes with physical impairments in disability sport
SO QUALITATIVE RESEARCH IN SPORT EXERCISE AND HEALTH
AB The use of assistive technology (AT) in sport raises critical questions about disability, access, equity, and embodiment in culture and society. In this paper, we seek to provide some clarity on the various ways that disabled people use, interact with, and experience AT through engagement in disability sport. Using semi-structured interviews, this paper centralises the experiences of twelve athletes with different physical impairments as they use AT for sports participation. We highlight a diverse range of experiences, illustrating how ATs function to provide athletes with a sense of embodied freedom and (im)possibilities, as well as exploring the influence of AT on athletes' construction of self and other. Finally, we provide some insight into the dimensions of access that are required to fully utilise AT in sport, specifically focusing on the process of learning to use and respond to AT. We envisage this paper may inform disability and AT scholars, advocates, and sports sociologists as they build on and extend empirical work and advocacy at the intersection of AT, disability, and sport.

TI A SYSTEMIC REVIEW OF SMART TECHNOLOGY SPORT BRAS FOR EXAMINING
   CARDIOVASCULAR FUNCTION
SO JOURNAL OF KINESIOLOGY AND EXERCISE SCIENCES
AB Background: Unremitting advancements in wearable technology provides female consumers a plethora of fabricated garments that claim to monitoring biological function. This systematic review examined current literature pertaining to smart technology sport bras fabricated to assess cardiovascular function. Methods: The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) was utilized, and the review was registered in the International prospective register of systemic reviews (PROSPERO) within the National Institute for Health and Care Research (NIHR). A total of 949 articles were screened after using key search terms using the Covidence systematic review software. Articles were sourced from PubMed, SPORTDiscus, or Medline via OVID databases. Results: A total of 19 articles were examined for eligibility and was reduced to a total of three articles to be included in the review. The results from this systematic review highlight the paucity of commercially available sport bras capable of accurately examining cardiovascular function during rest and exercise, while concomitantly providing the necessary support and comfort requirements for females. Of the commercially available sport bras, the Berlei sport bras was identified as the most accurate for recording cardiovascular stress during resting, walking, and running conditions. The three studies included in this review demonstrate strong potential for washable and flexible e-textile sensors with sufficient accuracy in pressure ranges that can be used in sport bras to monitor biological functioning. Conclusions: Future research should prioritize enhancing participant diversity in the examination of smart sport bras to ensure comprehensive inclusion of all body types.

AB Innovation is nothing new to sport, but represents everything that is 'ew' and adopted to facilitate a competitive advantage. In the sport context, innovations that are solutions to a pre-identified problem or need are critical to developing sport and for maximising the experiences and performances of individuals and organisations. Advances in sport technology are part of the growing global sports and recreation industry, and at the individual level, technology innovation is changing the way that we practice and connect with sport. In this paper, we apply a model for programmed innovation in sport to an elite sport setting with a particular focus on team sports. Using a qualitative methodology we explore the perceptions of key stakeholders (such as sport managers, coaches, athletes, and science and engineering researchers) to investigate needs for technology innovation. The results demonstrate areas of key opportunity for technology innovation in the research and commercialisation context. Crown Copyright (C) 2014 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In response to the problems of low recognition accuracy, slow recognition speed, and high operating costs in traditional early childhood sports action recognition technology, this article can use Kinect to study the early childhood action recognition model, which can provide strong support for the analysis and recognition of early childhood sports actions. Kinect can be used to obtain sports action data for young children, and after a series of data collection and processing, action features can be extracted. In terms of action recognition algorithm design, a model is constructed based on dynamic time warping algorithm, which can be trained through a large amount of data to improve the accuracy of recognizing young children's actions. The experimental results show that by extracting 7 types of motion, the accuracy of the action recognition model constructed in this paper for these 7 types of motion recognition is above 95.43%, with an average of 97.08%. This article uses Kinect to study young children's physical movements, which can effectively improve the accuracy of action recognition, reduce recognition costs, and improve recognition speed, bringing more innovation and breakthroughs to early childhood physical education.

AB We have built Drift, an application that measures and provides feedback on how far from the ideal path an orienteer has deviated, to study how sports apps can draw on real-time data to enrich sports activities. Orienteering is an outdoor navigation sport requiring mental skills and fast running through the terrain. Participants appropriated deviation into their practice and found new ways it could integrate with common orienteering practice. Interaction around deviation provided possibilities for new forms of sporting practice and social interactions. Deviation as a measure allowed this because it was highly specific and well-grounded in a specific skill of the sport. We believe this use of data in real time has the possibility of supporting and renewing sports activity as well as offering new opportunities for design.

AB Take the instant replay system as an example, the role of AI technology in sports competition is very important. The fact that the technical principle of the instant playback system is not complicated, it is also very precise to separate the stereo space of the field into several units of measurement computed in millimeters. Using high-speed cameras to capture tennis flight tracks, you can generate three-dimensional images through the computer, and finally use real-time imaging technology to make the ball drop points of the network clearly presented on the big screen. The application of artificial intelligence technology in sports competitions is not only stopped in tennis competitions, but also whether the electronic generator and piezoelectric sensing technology can effectively reduce the misjudgment in sports competitions, and make the competition results more objective and fair.

TI Assessment of the Development of Sports Volunteer Movement Using
   Information Technologies
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
AB The aim of the research was to develop a methodology for assessing the level of development of sports volunteer movement in the region on the basis of monitoring the indicators of the organizational and managerial model using information systems to support decision-making. As research methods, we used a group of methods for collecting and processing primary information, including an expert survey, ranking, methods of mathematical statistics, content analysis, high-level expert systems. The article discusses information technologies used in volunteering at the stages of selecting candidates for volunteers and working with them at events. We present an express assessment of the volunteer movement in the region according to four indicators (the number of organizers, volunteers, events, and projects) with a five-point scale each. Express assessment is developed for five types of regions, depending on the population size: (1) up to 500 thousand people; (2) up to 1 million; (3) from 1 to 2 million; (4) from 2 to 3 million; (5) more than 3 million. There are five levels of development of the volunteer movement: high (17-20 points), above average (13-16 points), average (9-12 points), below average (5-8 points), low (0-4 points). The article describes the creation of a decision support information system for the formation of effective interaction between all subjects in the management of the sports volunteer movement in the region. The indicators and criteria of the control unit of the organizational and management model we had developed were taken as a basis. To determine the weight of each criterion, an expert survey was conducted, in which heads of non-profit organizations of various types, heads and employees of state institutions with expert knowledge in the field of volunteer activities management, practical experience of interaction with them from Omsk, Moscow, Krasnoyarsk, Chita, Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, Yekaterinburg, and Almaty (Kazakhstan). The article presents two scenarios depending on the level of development of the sports volunteer movement in the region (high and low). However, when specifying the results of the database, the number of scenarios can be increased by levels: low, below average, average, above average, high. The developed methodology makes it possible to approach in a structured way the assessment of the functioning of the volunteer movement in the constituent entity of the Russian Federation and identify its problems. It is also advisable to use the methodology for a comparative assessment of the development of the volunteer movement in the constituent entities of the Russian Federation, including the sports one, which will determine the further vector of the development of volunteering in the region.

AB Exploration and play are core components of sports-related computer science learning. This study explores how youth collaborate and compete in an activity with an AI-embedded sports application. The activity design and technology fosters interactions where the youth leverage their bodies, social interactions, and the camera's view to construct knowledge around computational concepts and gaming practices. Through interaction analysis of video recordings, we examine how social and embodied engagement with the technology's live camera feed enables an interplay between collaboration and competition. The study highlights the value of designing sports technologies and experiences for social sensemaking where youth have opportunities to collaboratively make sense of how these technologies work, such that they can use them productively while being aware of possible shortcomings. Designing game-based sports training technologies like this opens up space for shared social sensemaking around complex technologies, and developing computing knowledge while improving athletic skill.

TI Sport humanism: contours of a humanist theory of sport
SO JOURNAL OF THE PHILOSOPHY OF SPORT
AB The world of sports today is grappling with dehumanizing tendencies. New technologies are changing sport as we know it, altering the experience of being an athlete in radical ways. These tendencies call for new approaches to sport that consider the human elements of sport. To this end, and as a response to transhumanist and posthumanist arguments, I propose and draw the contours of a humanist theory of sport. I argue that it complements prevailing theories of sport like formalism, broad internalism (or interpretivism), and conventionalism and is better equipped to tackle the pressing concerns of dehumanization in sports. It is rooted in a humanism of embodiment and underscores our corporeal embeddedness in a natural and social world. Taking this into the context of sport, I argue that sport humanism can inform an understanding of sport as a human engagement that involves embodiment, ambiguity, and repetition. On this basis, I outline an ethics of embodiment that can throw new light on moral questions and actions concerning dignity, freedom, and ecology to direct sport toward more sustainable and humane forms of practice.

AB The current data acquisition methods use sensors and fixed equipment to collect data. When applied to sports events, a large number of sensor deployment will lead to large data transmission loss and low data acquisition efficiency. In order to reduce the data transmission loss and improve the efficiency of data acquisition, the sports event data acquisition method based on BP neural network and wireless sensor technology will be studied. After building the wireless sensor network for sports event data acquisition, BP neural network is used to fuse the sensor node data. Compressed sensing is used to initially locate the sensor nodes in the network, and the sensor node data is gathered according to the honeycomb principle to realize the event data collection. The test results show that after the application of the proposed data acquisition method, the average energy loss ratio of the node is only 6.61%, the data acquisition efficiency is greatly improved, and the test effect is good.

AB In recent years, technology has played an increasing role in many sports, including swimming. Far beyond the stopwatch and hand marked events, detailed biomechanical attributes can be measured using technology such as instrumented blocks, wire tethers and underwater/dolly cameras. With the advent of micro-technology, there has been an increasing trend toward the use of wearable sensors such as heart rate monitors, cadence aids and more recently - activity monitors. The micro-electromechanical system (MEMS)-based inertial sensor class of activity monitor is of particular interest to the CWMA (Centre for Wireless Monitoring and Applications) at Griffith University. Due to the intensely competitive nature of professional sport, the difference between winning and not winning can be as little as a few hundredths of a second. An improvement to any single physiological or psychological parameter could potentially give one athlete a 'winning edge' over his or her competitors. This paper provides a context-driven needs assessment to illustrate the use of technology in various situational contexts related to swimming. The end goal is to improve training outcomes by allowing the strategies and requirements of stakeholders to be targeted. (C)) 2013 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

SO ANNALS OF APPLIED SPORT SCIENCE
AB Background. The sports industry plays an important role in the progress of the economy in developed countries. The role of technology is remarkable in the enhancement of the economy. Objectives. The present study investigates the effects of technology spillover on the economic growth of Iran's sports industry through import of intermediate and capital goods for the period from 1974 to 2012. Methods. The research method was econometrics and autoregressive distributed lag model was used. To do so, the following categories of data was analyzed by Eviews software: value added to cultural, recreational and sports services; current and construction expenditures of the government compared to the GDP (government size); import of intermediate and capital goods; capital stock of sports and active economic population of the sports section. Results. The results of model estimation showed that technology spillover has a significant and positive effect on the economic growth of Iran's sports industry (p<0.05) both in the short and the long term. The error correction model also indicated a speedy movement of distortions and imbalances towards the long-term equilibrium. Conclusion. The findings show that import of capital and intermediate goods creates the context for increased productivity in Iran's sports sector by facilitating access to the required intermediate agent and global technologies for organizations.

TI Timing and Imaging Evidence in Sport: Objectivity, Intervention, and the
   Limits of Technology
SO JOURNAL OF SPORT & SOCIAL ISSUES
AB This article analyzes timing and imaging systems used as sports decision aids (SDAs). Evidence of athletic performance in the form of timing and imaging data is the product of distinct interactions between humans, technology, and the live environment. As such, sports decisions are fallible. Yet the measurement of athletic performance is often presented as irrefutable thanks to enhanced technological precision. As this article shows, there are limits to the accuracy of timing and imaging systems as they are deployed in the physical environment, but such limits are rarely acknowledged in the public and professional discourse surrounding elite-level sport. To address this issue, the article analyses three sporting decisions: the 100 m butterfly race between Michael Phelps and Milorad Cavic at the 2008 Beijing Olympics; the third-place tie between Jeneba Tarmoh and Alysson Felix at the 2012 U.S. Olympic Trials; and the gold medal tie between skiers Tina Maze and Dominique Gisin at the 2014 Olympic games. The article examines the professional and public discourse surrounding each event as well as the regulations governing timing and imaging data in each sport to stress the situatedness and fallibility of SDAs. The article identifies limits to the accuracy of timing and imaging systems as they are deployed in the physical environment and calls on sports regulating bodies to clearly articulate the capabilities and limitations of timing and imaging systems in the production of evidence.

Key to my experiments is this question: what if, instead of aiding sport and social agency, music comes into existence as the direct result of such actions? In sports like cricket and badminton, their binary and competitive natures can serve as musical structure. In cycling, mechanisms and mobile possibilities extend the performance parameters of the sonic arts, while the physical presence of a huge interactive ball brings the experience of electronic music into democratic hands. Employing both analogue and digital interactive technologies, my investigations have led to unconventional outcomes, including game projects that evoke key philosophical approaches to play' central to both music and sport.

TI How Sports Involvement and Brand Fit Influence the Effectiveness of
   Sports Sponsorship from the Perspective of Predictive Coding Theory: An
   Event-Related Potential (ERP)-Based Study
SO BRAIN SCIENCES
AB Background/Objectives: With the rapid expansion of the global sports market, the significance of sports sponsorship has attracted growing attention. However, during the golden age of the sports industry's development in China, international sports brand giants such as Nike, Adidas, and Under Armour have rapidly captured a substantial share of the Chinese sports consumer market through their distinctive product designs and varied marketing strategies. This has resulted in a highly competitive environment for China's sports goods industry. Therefore, fostering the improved development of domestic sports brands has become a crucial issue deserving of thorough scholarly investigation. This study examines how consumers' differing levels of sports involvement and the degree of fit between the sponsoring brand and the sponsored event affect their cognitive and emotional responses to sports sponsorships. Methods: By employing Predictive Coding Theory and ERP (event-related potential) brainwave technology, this study delves into the psychological and neurobiological levels to analyze the impact of consumer sports involvement on the processing of sponsorship information. Results: The results indicate significant differences in cognitive and emotional responses between high-involvement and low-involvement consumers. Additionally, the fit between the sponsoring brand and the sponsored event also significantly affects consumers' cognitive and emotional responses. These differences stem from consumers' complex and sophisticated predictive coding models. Conclusions: This study not only provides scientific evidence for sports brands in selecting and executing sponsorship activities, but also offers new perspectives for evaluating and optimizing sponsorship effectiveness.

SO RICYDE-REVISTA INTERNACIONAL DE CIENCIAS DEL DEPORTE
AB Only a few studies have examined issues related to sport stakeholders' (e.g., athletes', spectators', and coaches') perceived value of technology products and its influence on the purchase intention of sport technology. The model of value-based stakeholders' loyalty toward sport technology (MVLST) is offered to inform customer purchase intentions of technology-based products by proposing theoretical relationships between perceived value, brand attitude, and purchase intention. The MVLST leverages core aspects of the technology acceptance model (TAM) and salient product attributes as quality, price, and innovativeness to develop the perceived value of sport technology (PVST). To test the theoretical relationships proposed in MVLST, a structural equation model was performed. Finally, multi-group SEM was employed to examine the moderating effect of consumer involvement. A total of 341 useful cases were collected from key stakeholders (e.g., spectators, coaches, and athletes) attending the 2010 US Open Taekwondo Championship; the technology-based product assessed by these survey participants was the electronic body protector and scoring system. The results of this analysis demonstrate that: (i) Usefulness, quality, and price are important value dimensions for attitude; (ii) conative loyalty (i.e., purchase intention) toward a sport technology occurs as consumers develop positive value perceptions and attitude toward the product; and (iii) the purchase intention of high vs. low involvement groups is dissimilarly influenced by the proposed value dimensions. From a theoretical perspective, the current study sheds light on the importance of attitude as a mediating variable and involvement as a moderating variable.

TI Virtual Reality Experience of Mega Sports Events: A Technology
   Acceptance Study
SO JOURNAL OF THEORETICAL AND APPLIED ELECTRONIC COMMERCE RESEARCH
AB Digitalization has advanced to become an opportunity to spectate sports during the pandemic and its restrictions for traveling to competitions. The purpose of this study is to investigate the antecedents of using virtual reality technology for spectating mega sports events. Based on a literature review, the authors created a model of behavioral intention, built on the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology and technology acceptance model to examine the curiosity and self-construal of spectators. An online survey obtained empirical evidence from 339 sports enthusiasts. The research model was fitted using the partial least squares algorithm. The results show that all the antecedents significantly affected the intention to use a VR device to spectate mega sports events, which explains a significant variance. Surprisingly, influences arising from social norm predominated over those arising from curiosity and the hedonic exploration of VR (enjoyment, and experience). The social norm strongly influences a VR device's perceived usefulness, implying that people believe using VR will enhance their position in society and that they will thus perceive the technology as being more beneficial. The novelty of this study arises from quantifying the importance of curiosity's relationship to VR acceptance and pinpointing the relevance of self-construal for VR acceptance.

TI The Impact of Wearable Technologies on Marginal Gains in Sports
   Performance: An Integrative Overview on Advances in Sports, Exercise,
   and Health
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Wearable technologies have become increasingly popular in recent years, as athletes and coaches look for ways to gain a competitive edge. These devices can track a variety of metrics, including heart rate, sleep quality, and movement patterns. This information can be used to identify areas for improvement and make small, incremental changes that can lead to significant gains in performance. The purpose of this narrative review is to provide an integrative overview of the literature on the impact of wearable technologies on marginal gains in sports performance. The literature review was conducted using the Scopus, PubMed, and Web of Science databases, and a total of 55 papers were considered eligible. The results of the literature overview suggest that wearable devices can be classified into three main categories. (1) Location-based wearables (LBW) track an athlete's location and movement, which can be used to analyze training patterns and identify potential injury risks. (2) Biometric wearables (BMW) track physiological data such as heart rate, sleep quality, and body temperature; these data can be used to monitor an athlete's fitness levels and identify signs of overtraining. (3) Performance wearables (PMW) track performance metrics such as power output, speed, and distance; this information can be used to optimize training programs and track progress over time. For each category, this paper provides the five most important data points measured by each suggested device. Additionally, sport-specific examples are provided for each category based on the literature data. The limitations of wearable devices, such as accuracy, validity, reliability, interpretability, and cost, are also discussed. However, despite these limitations, the results of the literature review suggest that wearable technologies can be a valuable tool for athletes and coaches who are looking to improve performance. Ultimately, this technological evolution in sports science is likely to dramatically change the state of the art in athletic monitoring and sports analytics.

TI The sociology of emotion in elite sport: Examining the role of
   normalization and technologies
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW FOR THE SOCIOLOGY OF SPORT
AB Recent research has examined the role of negative emotion norms and elite athletes' decisions to continue to train in sport when they are not physically healthy enough to do so. According to Lee Sinden ((2010) The normalization of emotion and the disregard of health problems in elite amateur sport. Journal of Clinical Sport Psychology 4: 241-256; (2012) The elite sport and Christianity debate: Shifting focus from normative values to the conscious disregard for health. The Journal of Religion and Health), athletes are persuaded to accept negative perceptions of emotions through a process called "normalization of emotion". The author draws on Foucault ((1977) Discipline and Punish: The Birth of the Prison. New York: Vintage Books) and Shogan ((1999) The Making of High-Performance Athletes: Discipline, Diversity, and Ethics. Toronto, ON: University of Toronto Press), to show how normalization works through an athlete's emotions using methods of normalizing, including hierarchical observation, normalizing judgment, and the examination (Lee Sinden, 2010, 2012). The author discusses how negative perceptions of emotion, described as "technologies of emotion" (Lee Sinden, 2010, 2012), are a collection of historical myths that continue to work in elite sport to homogenize athletes' outward emotional expressions. The consequence of normalization of emotion is the disassociation of athletes with their thoughts and feelings, and the potential subsequent suppression of concerns, such as training intensities and health. The following paper explores the theories of "normalization of emotion" and "technologies of emotion" in more detail. Through understanding how negative perceptions of emotions are socialized in sport, and the consequences of socializing emotions in this way, researchers and sport advocates may realize the need for a paradigm shift in the way elite sport understands and celebrates athletes' diverse emotionalities.

SO ELECTRONIC JOURNAL OF E-LEARNING
AB Improve students' ability to link knowledge with real life practice, through enhancing children or teenagers' ability to think critically by way of making observations, posing questions, drawing up hypotheses, planning and carrying out investigations, analysing data and therefore improve their decision making is an educational challenge. Learning through sports can be effective for developing life skills because sport has a potential to contribute over a wide range and is a discipline that most children like. The constructions of real situations or "Problems" must achieve and incorporate certain aspects such as (a) encourage curiosity, (b) be perceived by students as relevant to their personal goals, (c) represent a motivated challenge, (d) stimulate group collaboration for older students, (e) technological equipment as a way of support, to motivate the learning process, and (f) demonstrate how simple scientific concepts can improve everyday activities. The aim of this paper is to present and evaluate the usefulness of the representative tasks created by a systematic integration of approaches (electronic and non-electronic devices) with interactive situations. Four tasks were applied to 140 children between 6-10 years old at elementary school level. The tasks were constructed considering the follow proposals: (1) promote the benefit of physical activity and (2) explore some science concepts using sport. To evaluate the process effectiveness, two groups were formed, group A was submitted to a more theoretical explanation of the concepts and group B was exposed to problem solving through sport situations. Data were analysed by using quantitative methods. Results show that when children participate in an active way they are more motivated, and the use of their own movement or body to resolve a problem (with electronic devices) contributes for knowledge acquisition by adapting their actions and looking for the best window of possibilities to solve the task situation. Further and longitudinal studies are recommended to consolidate the results.

AB While the significance of digital technologies like big data marketing is recognized in sport and health industries, the deployment is not in a fast pace as expected. Previous investigations argue that the financial issue can be the reason explaining such hesitation for sport and health firms to widely adopt advanced digital technologies. Through integrating firms in global sport and health industries, it is shown that the digital technology adoption can be negatively associated with firms' financial status. Therefore, the digital technologies are expensive, and the provision of sufficient financial incentives can be important to facilitate the promotion of digital technologies in sport and health industries.

TI Shifting boundaries in sports technology and disability: equal rights or
   unfair advantage in the case of Oscar Pistorius?
SO DISABILITY & SOCIETY
AB In Paralympic sports, athletes often depend on some form of equipment to enable activities of daily living, including the ability to participate in sport. Determining precisely when technology assists sports performance and when it transforms or distorts them presents a philosophical and ethical dilemma. We raise the conceptual problem of line-drawing between promoting rights of access to equipment that provide equal opportunity while proscribing 'boosting' technology where athletes with a disability are afforded an unfair advantage. We set out a multidisciplinary analysis regarding the Olympic eligibility for Oscar Pistorius, the double-amputee world record holder, who runs with transtibial prostheses. We present scientific data comparing the prosthesis with an anatomical limb, and then contextualise the issue of shifting the boundaries of sports technology and disability to inform better policy-making in relation to the athlete-technology eligibility debate.

SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB Background In an increasingly digitalized world, the impact of digital technology on sports consumption behavior is a pivotal area of study, particularly among college students who are highly engaged with digital platforms.Methods This study investigates how digital technology use shapes college students' sports consumption behavior, incorporating emotional experience as a mediator and symbolic perception as a moderator. Guided by the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) framework and Symbolic Consumption Theory (SCT), data from 861 Chinese college students (511 males and 350 females) were analyzed using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM).Results Results reveal that digital technology use significantly enhances sports consumption, not only through a direct effect but also indirectly by improving emotional experience. Furthermore, symbolic perception amplifies the effect of emotional experience on consumption behavior. These findings highlight the dual psychological pathways through which technology influences sports-related decisions.Conclusion The study offers theoretical contributions by integrating emotional and symbolic mechanisms, and provides practical insights for sports marketers and educators aiming to engage college students in digital-era consumption.

   technology
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF GLOBAL ENERGY ISSUES
AB Smart sensors are sensors with data processing functions. They are equipped with microprocessors capable of collecting, processing and exchanging data, and are the product of the integration of sensors and microprocessors. This article aims to study the impact of smart sensors and blockchain technology on sports data fusion, and introduces a hierarchical model of sports athletes corresponding to the motion capture data. A human motion coordination system and reliable construction algorithm based on reliability and probability are proposed. This paper also proposes a data integration algorithm that enables applications in blockchain technology to run at a high speed, which extends the life cycle of network sensors to a certain extent. Blockchain technology is to use blockchain data structure to verify and store data, use distributed node consensus algorithm to generate and update data, use cryptography to ensure the security of data transmission and access, and use smart contracts composed of automated script codes. The experimental results of this article show that through the dynamic analysis algorithm of the smart sensor, it can be obtained that the visual range of the motion data is 22.5, and the network space value is 200. At the same time, it also shows that the use of distributed compressed sensing technology in blockchain technology can reduce the amount of information transmission in some aspects, and improve the speed and accuracy of data fusion.

TI Hybrid performances in sport: Cybathlon spectatorship for critically
   imagining technologies for disability futures
SO MEDICAL HUMANITIES
AB Disabled bodies have been historically marginalised in sporting arenas and spectacles. Assistive technologies have been increasingly featuring in, and changing, sporting landscapes. In some ways recent shifts have made disability more present and visible across many (para) sporting cultures, and yet sport continues to operate on a tiered system that assumes a normative able body. This paper responds to this moment by offering imaginaries of future hybrid performances that critically engage with the politics and possibilities of novel technologies in sporting arenas and their wider impact on disability futures. These were generated from a collaborative ethnography that centred on becoming spectators of the Cybathlon Games. The Cybathlon Games began in 2016 as a global event where people with disabilities compete with technologies such as Brain-Computer Interfaces or robotic Prosthesis. Our imaginings are presented as three speculative fragments in the form of pages ripped from a comic book series, The In/Visibles. These fragments and critical reflections are grounded on themes generated through watching the Games together. The purpose of this paper is not to offer predictions or even visions of desirable futures. Rather we present future technologised sporting bodies and spectacles with a view to extend critical posthuman discussions to these arenas. Through this we highlight: (1) The arbitrariness of where to draw the between un/natural performances; (2) The absurdities of unrestricted and open use of performance technologies when hybrid forms and functions are judged through current sporting-humanist values; and (3) The need to stay alert to socioeconomic and political drivers of sporting and disability futures. We offer these three zones of friction to guide further research when navigating the complex and shifting relations between sport, technology and the (dis)abled body now and into the future.

SO JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE AND PHYSICAL FITNESS
AB The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has had an unprecedent impact on the world of sport and society at large. Many of the challenges with respect to integrity previously facing competitive sport have been accentuated further during the pandemic. Threats to the integrity of sporting competition include traditional doping, issues of technological fairness, and integration of transgender and intersex athletes in elite sport. The enforced lull in competitive sport provides an unprecedented opportunity for stakeholders in sport to focus on unresolved integrity issues and develop and implement long-lasting solutions. There needs to be a concerted effort to focus on the many technological innovations accelerated by and perfected during COVID-19 that have enabled us to work from home, such as teaching students on-line, applications for medical advice, prescriptions and referrals, and treating patients in hospitals/care homes via video links and use these developments and innovations to enhance sport integrity and anti-doping procedures. Positive sports integrity actions will require a considered application of all such technology, as well as the inclusion of "omics" technology, big data, bioinformatics and machine learning/artificial intelligence approaches to modernize sport. Applications include protecting the health of athletes, considered non-discriminative integration of athletes into elite sport, intelligent remote testing to improve the frequency of anti-doping tests, detection windows, and the potential combination with omics technology to improve the tests' sensitivity and specificity in order to protect clean athletes and deter doping practices.

AB With the increase of time, the problem of image quality reduction caused by unbalanced network load will appear in the real-time broadcasting of sports events. A real-time broadcasting method of sports events is designed by using wireless network communication technology. Audio and video decoding and coding are divided into two independent threads working at the same time, which can make the frame rate reach the HD standard and enhance the stability of the encoding and decoding process. The GAN model is used to enhance the rate conversion. In the inter frame mode, integer transformation, quantization, reordering and entropy coding are performed on the residual block to complete the coding of the macroblock, which is stored or transmitted through the NAL layer. Wireless network communication technology is applied to distribute the number of channels in the space of mutual interference and balance the load of relay network. For the viewer, after receiving the streaming media data block, analyze the RTP packet, decode the video data, and then play the video. The test results showthat the real-time broadcastingmethod of sports events usingwireless network communication technology can improve PSNR, reduce the distortion of video sequence and ensure the stability of output picture.

TI Problem-oriented Teaching Mode based on Data Mining Technology in the
   Sports Psychology Classroom
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN LEARNING
AB Sports psychology is a branch of psychology and is a sports course that takes both theory and practice into account. It is not only an integral part of the talent training curriculum system of sports colleges and universities, but also a basic compulsory course for social sports majors in comprehensive universities. Sports psychology has currently become one of the significant theories in PE teaching, which not only guides PE teaching, but also helps solve existing problems in PE teaching and drives the development of PE teaching. Subject to the impact of traditional education mode and educational concept, etc., however, there are some problems in the existing the teaching of sports psychology, such as students' low interest, poor initiative and poor educational effect. To raise students' learning interest, this paper selected a problemoriented modular teaching mode, and applied it to the sports psychology classroom, to improve the learning effect. In this study, we first used data mining technology to build an anxiety prediction model and then identified a problem to be solved. After that, the problem was designed and analyzed, the known problem was confirmed, new information was collected, old and new knowledge was integrated, until the problem was finally solved. On this basis, based on virtual simulation technology, an experimental simulation teaching system for sports psychology was presented. It was found through research that the problems-oriented teaching mode can significantly enhance the effect of sports psychology and PE teaching and increase students' learning initiative. The learning effect was significantly better than that of traditional teaching methods.

We have analyzed the metrics of school readiness among preschool age children of three social groups: kindergarden children, children from group homes, and children attending a health and fitness club. Based on the analysis of their physical activity, we have developed the framework and content for an educational technology aimed at promoting the physical, psychological and intellectual readiness to attend school in children of different social groups. Additionally, the children's physical activity routine included active game classes as well as posture and coordination exercise. The effectiveness of the developed technology has been tested through an 8-month long educational experiment. After its conclusion, children of each social group have shown improved morphofunctional development, physical fitness, and social adjustment. The metrics of children's school readiness have changed as well: 78% of kindergarden children, 83% of health and fitness club children, and 56% of group home children have demonstrated readiness for primary school education programs.

SO REVISTA DE PSICOLOGIA DEL DEPORTE
AB The complexities of financial management in sports enterprises are magnified by the rapid pace of economic globalization and the increasing integration of advanced technologies. This paper examines the pivotal roles of block chain Web3 technology and deep learning in reshaping financial strategies within the sports and fitness sectors. With the proliferation of big data and cloud computing, sports organizations are seeking innovative ways to enhance their financial operations and maintain competitiveness in a volatile market. We explore how block chain Web3 technology can be applied to improve transparency, reduce transaction costs, and secure financial transactions, thereby enhancing the financial integrity of sports enterprises. Additionally, deep learning algorithms are analyzed for their capacity to provide predictive insights and early warning signals regarding financial risks, a crucial advantage in the dynamic sports market where financial stability is closely tied to seasonal performances and consumer interests. Furthermore, this paper addresses the existing challenges in the financial management of sports enterprises, highlighting how traditional methods may fall short in the face of evolving digital environments. We propose strategic applications of block chain and deep learning technologies, designed to foster more scientifically sound financial practices that support sustainable growth and operational efficiency in sports organizations. By integrating these advanced technologies, sports enterprises can better manage financial risks and capitalize on new opportunities for revenue generation and strategic expansion, ensuring longterm development and success in the increasingly competitive sports industry.

SO PHILOSOPHIES
AB The aim of the paper is confronting internal or intrinsic values of sport detected by different sport-philosophers, such as W. J. Morgan, J. S. Russell, R. L. Simon, N. Dixon, S. Kretchmar, to today's bio-technologized sports in order to find the ethical guidance for (non)acceptance of new bio-technologies in sport. Thus, in the first part, I will produce an overview of the internal values of sport in the sports-philosophical literature. In the second part, I will provide my understanding of 'bio-technologized sports', leaning mostly on W. J. Morgan's and S. Loland's previous work in this regard. In the third part, I will show that the key internal value of sport is 'excellence' and that the perfectionist account of sport dominates high-level professional competitive sports. However, I will show that 'excellence' is prone to different interpretations and understandings which (could) have different implications for the 'bio-technologized sport'. Finally, I will propose going back to Aristotle and his account of eudaimonia to build principles for the regulation of (non)acceptance of bio-technology in sport.

AB The paper introduces a novel pervasive computing based training concept aimed at elite sports. The concept goes beyond interactive sports equipments that are either individual or multiuser with a common display requiring participant's focus. These types of equipments are unable to support the kinesthetic empathic elements inherently present within open sports. To put focus on collective training, we draw inspiration from Kinesthetic Empathy Interaction in designing the collective training equipment, TacTowers. The TacTowers prototype is aimed at supporting athletes, particularly team handball players, in honing their psychomotor skills, in particular anticipation and decision making skills, in the one-on-one confrontation. TacTowers is a sensor-actuator based system, with LED lights and no screen-based display. It is placed between the players in order to reintroduce the kinesthetic empathic element in the interaction, specific to the sport. We present and discuss results of tests with two elite handball teams. We see prospects for applying the concept for entertaining movement-stimulating games at schools or leisure sports environments.

TI Fairness, technology and the ethics of Paralympic sport classification
SO EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF SPORT SCIENCE
AB Fairness in sport is a widely shared meritocratic norm. Its application is usually restricted to equality of opportunity to compete for victory. Paralympic sports lay down a further challenge in that equality of opportunity must be shaped by considerations of fairness, evidenced by the development of discrete competition categories to construct fair and meaningful contests. In this article, we extend these philosophical ideas to consider how Fair Equality of Opportunity might operate in the context of Paralympic sports classification. We articulate three conceptions of fairness relevant to these sports: (i) background fairness; (ii) procedural fairness; and (iii) stakes fairness. We critically review the International Paralympic Committee's Policy on Sport Equipment in relation to the first two conceptions and argue that greater clarification, theorization and rule modification is required if physical prowess, as opposed to equipment technology, is to be assured as the dominant determinant of Paralympic athletic success.

TI FROM THERAPY AND ENHANCEMENT TO ASSISTIVE TECHNOLOGIES: AN ATTEMPT TO
   CLARIFY THE ROLE OF THE SPORTS PHYSICIAN
SO SPORT ETHICS AND PHILOSOPHY
AB Sports physicians are continuously confronted with new biotechnological innovations. This applies not only to doping in sports, but to all kinds of so-called enhancement methods. One fundamental problem regarding the sports physician's self-image consists in a blurred distinction between therapeutic treatment and non-therapeutic performance enhancement. After a brief inventory of the sports physician's work environment I reject as insufficient the attempts to resolve the conflict of the sports physician by making it a classificatory problem. Followed by a critical assessment of some ideas from the US President's Council on Bioethics, the formulation of ethical codes and attempts regarding a moral topography, it is argued that the sports physician's conflict cannot be resolved by the distinction between therapy and enhancement. Instead, we also have to consider the possibility that the therapy-based paradigm of medicine cannot do justice to the challenges of the continuously increasing technical manipulability of the human body and even our cognitive functions as well. At the same time we should not adhere to transhumanist ideas, because non-therapeutic interventions require clear criteria. Based on assistive technologies an alternative framework can be sketched that allows for the integration of therapeutic and non-therapeutic purposes. After a thorough definition of standards and criteria, the role of the sports physician might be defined as that of an assistant for enhancement. Yet the process of defining such an alternative framework is a societal and political task that cannot be accomplished by the sports physicians themselves. Until these questions are answered sports physicians continue to find themselves in a structural dilemma that they partially can come to terms with through personal integrity.

TI Inertial Sensors for Performance Analysis in Combat Sports: A Systematic
   Review
SO SPORTS
AB The integration of technology into training and competition sport settings is becoming more commonplace. Inertial sensors are one technology being used for performance monitoring. Within combat sports, there is an emerging trend to use this type of technology; however, the use and selection of this technology for combat sports has not been reviewed. To address this gap, a systematic literature review for combat sport athlete performance analysis was conducted. A total of 36 records were included for review, demonstrating that inertial measurements were predominately used for measuring strike quality. The methodology for both selecting and implementing technology appeared ad-hoc, with no guidelines for appropriately analysing the results. This review summarises a framework of best practice for selecting and implementing inertial sensor technology for evaluating combat sport performance. It is envisaged that this review will act as a guide for future research into applying technology to combat sport.

AB ICT (information and communications technology) is part of nowadays professional sport training. And this happens to an open range: from educational software for sport to e-games used in kinesitherapy, from mobile devices and specific mobile applications for sport training to simulators, and passing through e-learning. As a direct consequence, the university program studies in physical education, sport training and kinesitherapy have to teach the future sport professionals more or less elementary notions in ICT. In order to distinguish what is important in sport from technology information viewpoint, one has to consider several questions: what a sport student is supposed to know about information technology, which branches of ICT are used in sport, what are the trends both in ICT and in sport training. In this paper we are interested to identify good practice for conceiving and upgrading ICT curricula for sport professionals. To answer the above questions, we investigate different directions. We survey the ICT related courses at important universities and physical education faculties from all over the world: at which level of study are they tough, what is their content, what software and devices are involved. We are also concerned about the trends in both computer science and sport training, and here the keywords are mobility and precision. Nowadays research in sport cannot be figured out without the benefit of computers. On one hand in doctoral studies, on the other hand for training national or Olympic teams, sport professionals collaborate with computer scientist, electronic engineers, and other types of scientists. To identify the place of ICT in their work, we browsed the main journals and conferences publishing their results. We can conclude that ICT is part of the famous university curricula for sport professionals, the content depends on the level of study and, at least at post-graduate level, the courses are adapted to the particular sport specialization. Another conclusion points out the necessary collaboration between sport and computer science professionals, in order to continuously adapt the curricula and the research to both sport performance and new technologies.

AB In sports, WT devices include sensors, GNSS, and IMU, and these devices give athletes real-time data to check their performance, physiological features, biomechanical features, and neuromuscular characteristics of metabolic exhaustion. Subsequently, many WT devices are used as the source of considerable improvement in sports training and reduction in injuries, and they also help in recovery from injuries. Hence, WT assists in the improvement of athlete's training activities that help to boost their performance. Many WT devices are equipped with accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometers used for training and competitions and also measure the quantification of an athlete's load. The research study was based on primary data analysis, which was used to measure the data using SPSS and AMOS software. Therefore, the demand for WT devices is increasing rapidly. Elite sports put emotional, physical and intellectual demands on athletes' careers, and it has a greater impact on their cognitive and physical health. Analyzing the physiological, biochemical and biomechanical characteristics of the real world for athletes is important to maintain their good health. However, these characteristics should be measured in the real world during their physical activity and competitive environment. These goals can be achieved using wearable technology measuring various parameters in training athletes. For instance, American football players used helmet accelerometers and eye-tracking technology to measure concussion injuries. Overall, the result found that wearable technology directly and significantly affects enhancing performance and monitoring health metrics in elite sports. Additionally, WT devices help in monitoring physiological factors during races with the help of biometric sensors that measure heart rate and pulls.

TI The Use of Extended Reality Technologies in Sport Perceptual-Cognitive
   Skill Research: A Systematic Scoping Review
SO SPORTS MEDICINE-OPEN
AB BackgroundExtended Reality (XR) technologies, such as Virtual Reality (VR) and 360 degrees VR are growing rapidly in the scientific literature and sporting practice. These have been used for a range of skills, particularly perceptual-cognitive skills. However, to our knowledge, there is no systematic scoping review on this topic identifying the current state of play of the research area by characteristics such as study type, technology type, or sport investigated, and such a review would help guide the future direction of this area. Therefore, this study aimed to systematically review the extent of XR technology in sport for assessing and training athletes' and officials' perceptual-cognitive skills.MethodsElectronic databases (SCOPUS, Web of Science, SPORTDiscus, PsycINFO) were searched for relevant articles up until January 2024. Studies were included if they used XR technologies to assess or develop sport-specific, higher order perceptual-cognitive skills.Results57 studies met the inclusion criteria for this review, of which 67% were published from 2020. Most studies conducted quantitative research designs, with 66% of studies adopting a cross-sectional assessment approach and 28% conducting an intervention to assess performance improvements. Decision-making was the most prevalent skill investigated, across 60% of studies. The most common technology was head mounted display (51%) presenting animated environments and the most common sports investigated were football and handball (32% and 19% of studies, respectively).ConclusionsThis review highlights a significant growth in the research exploring XR technologies in sport for perceptual-cognitive skill development and understanding, with most studies published in the last 4 years. Prominent technology types (e.g. animated HMD), perceptual-cognitive skills (e.g. decision making), study designs (e.g. quantitative assessment), and sports (e.g. football) are identified and discussed along with practical implications and future research.Key PointsExtended reality technologies for sports perceptual-cognitive skills is an emerging field, marked by key trends in the types of technology used and the perceptual-cognitive skills being studied.Decision-making is the most commonly studied perceptual-cognitive skill, and these technologies report to have high representativeness and engagement when being used.More research is required to explore the effectiveness of this technology through intervention study designs, and further understand how it can be used and the perceptual-cognitive processes through qualitative research designs.

AB The role of information technology in sports organizations is important to analyze all aspects including how to win in the competition based on various internal and external factors. The approach that used to enhance the sports organizations is sports science, which is a concept that contributes to the development of athletes by collaborating in many fields and studies, such as anatomy, physiology, psychology, engineering, chemistry, etc. The approach of Sport science articulates the technology that blended on all of the approached. Currently, the use of sports technology or science in Indonesia is also very low in all sports categories. Usually, the management and coaches look at player statistics based on manual data or reports to view player statistics periodically. There is still a lack of exploration to use player statistics to be used by coaches to improve the ability of the players and the organization. This research will propose how to develop sports science with a business intelligence approach that used the Kimball data mart approach as decision support in the field of sports so that management and coaches can apply the correct approach to improve the capacity of players and organizational development. The result of this study will provide the model of sports science that can be implemented for a professional sports organization in Indonesia.

TI The Implementation of Velocity-Based Training Paradigm for Team Sports:
   Framework, Technologies, Practical Recommendations and Challenges
SO SPORTS
AB While velocity-based training is currently a very popular paradigm to designing and monitoring resistance training programs, its implementation remains a challenge in team sports, where there are still some confusion and misinterpretations of its applications. In addition, in contexts with large squads, it is paramount to understand how to best use movement velocity in different exercises in a useful and time-efficient way. This manuscript aims to provide clarifications on the velocity-based training paradigm, movement velocity tracking technologies, assessment procedures and practical recommendations for its application during resistance training sessions, with the purpose of increasing performance, managing fatigue and preventing injuries. Guidelines to combine velocity metrics with subjective scales to prescribe training loads are presented, as well as methods to estimate 1-Repetition Maximum (1RM) on a daily basis using individual load-velocity profiles. Additionally, monitoring strategies to detect and evaluate changes in performance over time are discussed. Finally, limitations regarding the use of velocity of execution tracking devices and metrics such as "muscle power" are commented upon.

AB Sports and recreational activities provide an interesting domain of research that includes several of the critical challenges for next generation of services. The adoption of emerging Internet of Things technologies into the field of sport could significantly improve the sport experience and also the safety level of team sports. To this purpose, this paper presents a novel Sport System based on the jointly use of different technologies, such as RFID, WSN, Cloud, and mobile. It is able to collect, in real time, both environmental parameters and players' physiological data via an ultra-low-power Hybrid Sensing Network (HSN) composed of 6LoWPAN nodes integrating UHF RFID functionalities. Sensed data are delivered to a Cloud platform where a monitoring application makes them easily accessible via REST Web Services. A simple proof of concept has demonstrated the appropriateness of the proposed system. This work represents a first real attempt to demonstrate the benefits introduced by the use of IoT technologies in sport environments.

AB Technology integration in regular higher education classes seems to be pretty much standard in contemporary study programs on the college/university level. However, some particular subjects may adopt, apply, or even reject up-todate technology-enhanced teaching strategies slower or faster than others, due to subject content, tradition, or other various reasons. This study focuses on one of these subjects, namely Kinesiology/Sport Science, and emphasizes the students' perspective. To investigate how Kinesiology/Sport Science students rate their classes regarding technology use, all classes of a regular semester term (n=60) hosted by a German University's Department of Kinesiology/Sport Science were surveyed using a validated student ratings questionnaire (HILVE-II) that was adapted according to technology integration (n=713). In addition, students' media literacy and media behaviour was also assessed via questionnaire (n=154). As the "signature feature" of Kinesiology/Sport Science programs is the mandatory inclusion of gym-based (GB) courses that require students to learn and perform certain sports or physical activity tasks, this study's interest lies in a possible distinction of students' ratings regarding technology use between these GB courses and "normal" classroom-based (CB) courses. Results showed that students tend to acknowledge the positive significance of technology integration within their study program, although GB courses implement less technology-enhanced course designs. Cross-referencing diverse instructional media (e.g., book, projector, etc.) with GB courses and CB courses revealed that some media was rated less or more important for the respective course type. For instance, books and projectors were assessed less important for GB courses in comparison to CB courses. Linear regression showed that students' technology-use experience gathered from study program classes accounted for 21.7% of the variance in their technology-use significance-ratings for GB courses, whereas technology-use experience gathered from study program classes accounted for 24.5% of the variance in students' technology-use significance-ratings for CB courses. Conclusively, future study-program designs and tweaks may consider implementing and improving technology-enhanced course designs for both GB courses and CB courses to increase students' ratings in regard to technology-integration significance.

AB Intelligent identification technology has made great progress in transportation, and its application in sports has attracted widespread attention. This research mainly discusses the research of human motion recognition technology in sports dance video images. In geometric algebraic space, using instance templates, a new cfrdF method, using css-based similarity of human body features as features, to construct an angle-adaptive and continuous-scale space template matching algorithm to calculate the similarity between horizontal plates and detected images value, set a certain threshold, so as to match the area where the human body is located. Based on the actual video analysis and display, using the self-similar structure of the color of the human object as the basic feature, it is described by the geometric algebra method, and the human body in the video image is extracted using template convolution objects and design adaptive template functions to extract human movements from sports dance video images. By loading each test video in turn, the posture of the characters in the video is checked every 30 s, and the approximate positions of the head and feet are marked and output to a txt file. Because lying on the ground during sports dance is a way of matching by height correction, the accuracy is less disturbed, but it can still reach 90.9%. The research results show that the template matching robot model proposed in this paper can accurately and robustly extract human objects in video. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

TI Examining the cognitive flexibility of e-Sports players
SO VIREF-REVISTA DE EDUCACION FISICA
AB Objective: : to investigate the cognitive flexibility of individuals involved in e-sports, with a focus on socio-demographic factors. Method: : the Turkish version of the Cognitive Flexibility Inventory, as adapted by Sapmaz & Do & gbreve;an (2013), was administered to a sample of 206 e-sports athletes who were selected via convenience sampling. The data were subjected to analysis using SPSS version 29.0.1.0 (171). The data obtained was analyzed using the Mann Whitney-U and Kruskal-Wallis tests. Results: : based on the findings of the analysis, it was observed that within the cognitive flexibility inventory's control sub-dimension, there was no significant difference in relation to the gender variable among e-sports participants aged 18-23. However, when considering the frequency of exercise variable, favorable outcomes were obtained for e-Sports participants who engage in regular exercise. Furthermore, based on the analysis of the frequency and variability of technological device usage during exercise, it was determined that there is a positive correlation between the frequency of utilizing technological devices and cognitive flexibility scores. Conclusion: : consequently, the study's findings indicate that female participants within the age range of 18-23, individuals who engage in regular exercise, and those who utilize technology devices during exercise exhibit elevated levels of cognitive flexibility. The investigation of cognitive flexibility among e-sports players has the potential to enhance their individual performance and elevate the overall professionalism of the e-Sports industry. Recommendations: : to create and execute psycho-educational initiatives targeted at e-sports participants who exhibit limited cognitive flexibility. Competitive games are played under intense stress and pressure, which can adversely affect performance. These programs can help players develop stress coping strategies, enabling them to remain calmer and more focused during challenging moments and these programs aim to enhance the cognitive flexibility of e-sports participants, thereby improving their performance in competitive games, enabling them to effectively manage stress, and promoting a state of improved mental well-being. In this context, these programs can assist players in feeling better about themselves and becoming psychologically stronger. Enhancing mental well-being can help players approach games with a more positive attitude and play effectively for longer periods.

TI Teaching the economics of sports
SO JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC EDUCATION
AB A course on the economics of sports provides a unique opportunity to the economics department but confronts the instructor with unique challenges. Students in such a class are likely to be more heterogeneous and more likely to enter the class with inappropriate expectations than is the case for a typical upper-level economics elective. The author of this article discusses the problems an instructor in an economics of sports course will encounter and how s/he might overcome them. Particular emphasis is placed on the use of technology in the classroom and on how an economics of sports class might enable the instructor to raise issues of inclusion/exclusion in a nonthreatening manner. A course on the economics of sports provides a unique opportunity to economics departments. Because of the outsized interest of the American public in sports, an undergraduate course in the economics of sports can be a magnet that attracts students who otherwise might shy away from an upper-level economics course. It is far more likely to attract non-majors than our traditional offerings in labor economics or monetary theory.

TI The study of security application of LOGO recognition technology in
   sports video
SO EURASIP JOURNAL ON IMAGE AND VIDEO PROCESSING
AB With the rapid development of information technology and network technology and the rapid popularization of computers and intelligent devices, network video media have gradually replaced traditional media and became the main carrier of information production, storage, dissemination, sharing, and use. However, digital information can be easily copied, modified, and disseminated, which leads to the problem of network video copyright theft which is very prominent. Aiming at the copyright problem of sports video, this paper proposes an idea of using LOGO to identify the copyright of sports video, which can automatically and effectively detect whether the video is genuine or not. Firstly, encrypted LOGO is added to the video by encryption technology, and then, LOGO recognition technology is used to distinguish whether the LOGO is missing in the video, so as to distinguish the legitimacy of the video. In addition, aiming at the shortcomings of traditional LOGO recognition technology, this paper proposes a LOGO detection and recognition technology based on convolution neural network. This method improves the traditional histogram algorithm, proposes an analysis algorithm based on non-uniform block HSV histogram, and introduces region weighting coefficients to extract key frames from the video. Then, the convolution neural network is used to extract the features of the key frames of the video. Finally, the features of the sample LOGO are matched to complete the LOGO detection and recognition. Simulation results show that the effect of feature extraction using convolution neural network is better. Compared with the traditional LOGO recognition technology, the LOGO detection and recognition technology based on convolution neural network proposed in this paper has better detection and recognition performance. It effectively detects the LOGO information in the video and realizes the recognition of whether the video is genuine or not.

TI Application of IoT-enabled computing technology for designing sports
   technical action characteristic model
SO SOFT COMPUTING
AB Internet of Things (IoT) is frequently employed to improve human lives by monitoring various physical and mental activities. IoT may significantly improve the performance and advancement of athletes by collecting, analyzing, and tracking consumer data. Training and teaching are widely used in sports to exploit the benefits of various technologies such as image processing, computer vision, big data, and advanced artificial intelligence. In sports, the traditional technical movement analysis using video and high-speed photography is used to standardize action, which is essential for improving performance of the athletes. This paper uses IoT technology to build a feature model for technical actions in sports so that the manifestation of information can be more diversified and then collate, store, transmit, and process the multimedia data. It uses image processing technology to quantitatively analyze sports technical action to build an action model. It combines the forward kinematics of the human body based on the root bone using deep learning-enabled human bone recognition algorithm. Next, it uses the obtained information to construct the structural model of human body, and athletes' sports data are fed into it to complete the quantitative processing of action characteristics and pattern analysis. Finally, the application impact of the analysis model for striking force by the legs on sports athletes reveals that the maximum strike force of athletes is 486 N after reaching the target for 13 s, and then, it starts to fall. In sports training, the accuracy of each leg joint varies according to athletes' speed, wherein the contribution of the hip was 20.5%, the knee was 20.5%, and the ankle was 71.1%, respectively. As a result, the method presented in this study for forward kinematics of the human body provides a robust and fast technique for determining the position and attitude of rigid body chains. This approach eliminates repetitive computations and increases computing performance by focusing on the trunk bone first, recursive calculations, and transformation matrices. These developments lead to this paper's higher performance when compared to earlier research by making it a noteworthy addition to human body kinematics.

TI Introducing a Sport Experience Design (SX) framework for sport consumer
   behaviour research
SO SPORT MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB Sport Management Review celebrates 20 years of publishing research, and this milestone provides an opportunity to reflect on sport consumer research and offer possible directions for scholarship. This article utilizes a panel of 17 academic scholars to examine sport consumer research published in SMR as an exemplar; and then, more broadly, how to enhance sport consumer research and identify future trends in the sport industry. This information, combined with an article analysis, revealed two key findings. First, the quality of scholarship was acknowledged with noted weaknesses related to improving and diversifying methodology, stronger attention to theoretical development, and relevance to industry. Second, traditional boundaries of sport consumer research will expand due to technology, a broadening sport landscape, and links to other academic disciplines. In order to account for industry trends and address noted theoretical limitations, a Sport Experience Design (SX) framework is introduced, which consists of three interrelated elements: (a) the sport context in which a sport consumer navigates through an experience and interacts with touchpoints, (b) the sport user, with mental processes, psychological needs, and personal characteristics, and (c) the sport organization, which produces the sport experience to achieve organizational goals. The framework provides a holistic consumer centred approach that considers cognitive, organizational, and physical relevant design factors that enhance customer satisfaction and engagement by improving use and pleasure of sport experiences.

AB BackgroundInsightful motion analysis provides valuable information for athlete health, a crucial aspect of sports medicine. This systematic review presents an analytical overview of the use of various sensors in motion analysis for sports injury assessment.MethodsA comprehensive search of PubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted in February 2024 using search terms related to "sport", "athlete", "sensor-based technology", "motion analysis", and "injury." Studies were included based on PCC (Participants, Concept, Context) criteria. Key data, including sensor types, motion data processing methods, injury and sport types, and application areas, were extracted and analyzed.ResultsForty-two studies met the inclusion criteria. Inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensors were the most commonly used for motion data collection. Sensor fusion techniques have gained traction, particularly for rehabilitation assessment. Knee injuries and joint sprains were the most frequently studied injuries, with statistical methods being the predominant approach to data analysis.ConclusionsThis review comprehensively explains sensor-based techniques in sports injury motion analysis. Significant research gaps, including the integration of advanced processing techniques, real-world applicability, and the inclusion of underrepresented domains such as adaptive sports, highlight opportunities for innovation. Bridging these gaps can drive the development of more effective, accessible, and personalized solutions in sports health.

TI A Multi-Method Analysis of Sport Spectator Resistance to Augmented
   Reality Technology in the Stadium
SO JOURNAL OF GLOBAL SPORT MANAGEMENT
AB Past research in sports marketing examining technological innovations has predominantly focused on their acceptance by sport spectators. However, theoretical and empirical arguments suggest that investigating innovation resistance provides a distinct and complementary perspective to understanding spectators' responses to technological innovations. Therefore, the present study examines spectator resistance toward augmented reality (AR) technology used within the stadium. We explore adoption barriers to in-stadium AR, and empirically test their influence on three forms of resistance (postponement, rejection, and opposition). The study used a mixed-method approach comprised of qualitative in-depth interviews (N = 22) and a cross-national online survey (N = 1,206) targeting spectators in Germany and the UK. The study identified seven adoption barriers to in-stadium AR: distraction from the live experience, interference with fan rituals supporting the team, reduced social interactions, reduced emotionality in discussions, risk of personal image damage, fan identity incongruence, and loss of stadium atmosphere. These barriers mainly influenced the resistance forms of rejection and opposition, while the relation to postponement was weaker. Beyond AR technology, this research is the first to examine innovation resistance among sport spectators highlighting the importance to consider downsides of technological innovations and their consequences as well.

TI Sports entrepreneurship during COVID-19: Technology as an ally to
   maintain the competitiveness of small businesses
SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB The sports sector, specifically the field of personal trainer entrepreneurship, has been severely affected by the COVID-19 crisis. However, there are still few empirical studies that analyze how the actions taken before and during this crisis can affect sports entrepreneurs' performance. This research aims to analyze which combinations of sports entrepreneurs' personal characteristics and actions performed have been most and least effective in minimizing the negative impact of COVID-19 on their businesses. A validated online questionnaire was administered to personal trainer entrepreneurs from May to June 2020 before they reopened their facilities. Fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) was performed to assess the impacts. The results show that both post-COVID measures (adaptation of the business model) and previous strategic orientation seemed essential. Specifically, high levels of sports entrepreneurs' resilience and innovation/R&D when competing against their closest competitors before the COVID-19 pandemic and the increased use of technologies (sports services digitization) during the pandemic have been essential to maintaining the performance of the sports business. Thus, improvements in the digital competencies of personal trainers' sports entrepreneurs, the devel-opment of strategic plans and activities related to innovation/R&D and process improvements are important measures to maintain the competitiveness of small sports businesses during crises.

SO SPORT MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB The sport industry is not immune to the force digital technology brings in facilitating organizational change in sport organizations. Consequently, the purpose of the study was to explore the nexus of digital technology and organizational change in sport organizations, specifically identifying the presence of smaller digital changes and larger digital transformations. A collective case study of five Canadian national sport organizations undergoing organizational change was conducted; data derived from 49 semi-structured interviews and 151 documents. Results indicated these organizations engaged in a variety of digital changes like incorporating Microsoft 365, Zoom, and Samepage, and developing their own digital tools. Although these technologies fostered some larger digital transformations insofar as they enabled greater stakeholder communication and engagement, in the context of organizational change, digital technology remained predominantly at a small-scale, digital change level. The findings make it imperative for executives to reflect upon whether digital technology is being (un)intentionally disregarded from a strategic standpoint.

SO TECHNOLOGY AND HEALTH CARE
AB BACKGROUND: Visualization of sports has a lot of potential for future development in data sports because of how quickly things are changing and how much sports depend on data. Presently, conventional systems fail to accurately address sports persons' dynamic health data change with less error rate. Further, those systems are unable to distinguish players' health data and their visualization in a precise manner. An excellent starting point for building fitness solutions based on computer vision technology is the data visualization technology that arose in the age of big data analytics. OBJECTIVE: This research presents a Big Data Analytic assisted Computer Vision Model (BD-CVM) for effective sports persons healthcare data management with improved accuracy and precision. METHODS: The fitness and health of professional athletes are analyzed using information from a publicly available sports visualization dataset. Machine learning-assisted computer vision dynamic algorithm has been used for an effective image featuring and classification by categorizing sports videos through temporal and geographical data. RESULTS: The significance of big data's great potential in screening data during a sporting event can be reasonably analyzed and processed effectively with less error rate. The proposed BD-CVM utilized an error analysis module which can be embedded in the design further to ensure the accuracy requirements in the data processing from sports videos. CONCLUSION: The research findings of this paper demonstrate that the strategy presented here can potentially improve accuracy and precision and optimize mean square error in sports data classification and visualization.

TI Sports confinement and new technologies: coaches perspective
SO REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE FUTSAL E FUTEBOL
AB The formation in football is quite complex, requiring constant reflections on the new realities that emerge, such as the immersion in the environment of virtual social networks and the use of technologies, that add new insights to debates such as the importance of sports confinement, for example. This type of strategy is often adopted at competitive times, mainly aimed at increasing concentration. Thus, the aim was to understand the coaches' view of the importance of the confinement context and the possible changes that new technologies have brought to this reality. Ten coaches were interviewed, with a mean age of 47 years (+/- 11,5). As a result, most coaches find this confinement environment good and important. It is also possible to realize that there is an impact of technologies in this context, and despite considering positive aspects regarding social networks, most think that the use of mobile phones can compromise attention at important times. However, most do not consider it correct to remove them. Therefore, it was possible to verify that there is still an appreciation of the environment of confinement by the coaches, as well as that there is an impact of the new technological demands on it, which can then be an educational opportunity for young people about the related risks and disadvantages. Professionals' reflections on new demands are fundamental, planning effective attitudes and avoiding causing negative situations that can make the situation worse and generate more stress.

AB The Paralympic sport is the sport modalities that make up the Paralympic Games, applying adapted rules, specifics theories, and structures for people with disabilities. The objective of this research was to present the assistive technologies (AT) used by para-athletes, their satisfaction with AT devices and the services provided and, identify the main requirements for the good use of each AT and services, correlating barriers and facilitators for the practical of para-sports. The exploratory descriptive research consisted of 54 para-athletes with physical and sensory disabilities, who answered the Assistive Technology Evaluation (ATD PA-Br) and Client Satisfaction Evaluation with Assistive Technology of Quebec QUEST B. Seven different AT were cited and analyzed singly: manual wheelchairs, prosthesis, bracing, arm strap, insole, ball, and racket adapted. Among the items considered fundamental for the good use of the device, the safety, the comfort and effectiveness were cited in all AT devices. The most cited device was the wheelchair, 43% of the para-athletes were very satisfied with the device and 54% dissatisfied with the service provided to the AT. This study can identify some assistive technologies devices used in Paralympic sport and it is concluded that the items considered important to the use of AT, as well as user satisfaction and assistance provided, can either act as barriers or facilitators to the practice of parasport. It is noteworthy that there are still few studies that focus on assistive technologies and Paralympic sport.

TI The Application of Human-Computer Interaction Technology Fused With
   Artificial Intelligence in Sports Moving Target Detection Education for
   College Athlete
SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB The purposes are to digitalize and intellectualize current professional sports training and enrich the application scenarios of motion capture technology of moving targets based on artificial intelligence (AI) and human-computer interaction (HCI) in sports training. From an educational psychology perspective, sport techniques are a cognitive ability of sports, and a tacit knowledge. However, sports technology, language, image, and other methods play an auxiliary role in sports training. Here, a General Framework of Knowledge-Based Coaching System (KBCS) is proposed using the HCI technology and sports knowledge to accomplish autonomous and intelligent sports training. Then, the KBCS is applied to table tennis training. The athletic performance is evaluated quantitatively through the calculation of the sports features, motion recognition, and the hitting stage division in table tennis. Results demonstrate that the speed calculated by the position after mosaicking has better continuity after the initial frame of the unmarked segment is compared with the end frame of the market segment. The typical serve and return trajectories in three serving modes of slight-spin, top-spin, and back-spin, as well as the trajectories of common services and return errors, are obtained through the judgment of the serving and receiving of table tennis. Comparison results prove that the serving accuracy of slight-spin and back-spin is better than that of top-spin, and a lower serve speed has higher accuracy. Experimental results show that the level distribution of the three participants calculated by the system is consistent with the actual situation in terms of the quality of the ball returned and the standard of the motion, proving that the proposed KBCS and algorithm are useful in a small sample, thereby further improving the accuracy of pose restoration of athletes in sports training.

AB This paper aimed to explore the application method of VR technology in college sports popularization and teaching. In the research, this paper used the method of documentary analysis and comprehensive induction to explore the feasibility and specific method of VR technology in college sports popularization and teaching. The result showed that VR technology has both certain advantages and certain shortcomings in colleges sports popularization and teaching. Obviously, we can draw the conclusion that the integration of VR devices and college sports teaching can not only make teaching means more diverse to enrich the learning process and improve the teaching effectiveness, but also greatly motivate students' learning motive and interest to enhance their perception and enlighten their innovative association and creative thought to a greater extent. At present, VR technology has not been available in college teaching, and the certain talent pools and financial support have not been provided for the hardware and content development & application. So we hope that the relevant departments and enterprises can tackle the technical issues, establish VR teaching and learning pilot and gradually innovate and improve the teaching model in the future to provide a new and futuristic teaching classroom for the teachers and students.
   With the advent of the internet era, the integration of PE teaching and information technology has become more and more deep. Due to the introduction of MOOC and the interaction of flipped classroom, the momentous changes of PE teaching way and method have been caused. In modern college PE teaching, due to the shortage of space, facilities and resource for the training and experience of sports techniques, the amount and quality of training can not be guaranteed, and that may cause the relatively bad learning effect of motor skill and the low learning interest of students for PE class([1]). At the same time, for the technical movements that requires the specific movements of higher quality, the traditional teaching way both neither can make the initiators better understand the project, also is disadvantageous for the learners' fine perception and understanding. Now, the perfecting VR technology provides a good direction and thinking for the training of motor skill in PE teaching. The introduction of VR technology in PE teaching process can not only make the students better understand the characteristics of motor skill, but also make the advantages of information technology to be fully reflected in teaching by pertinently designing and displaying in accordance with each learner's interest([2]).

TI Evaluation of MRI-US Fusion Technology in Sports-Related Musculoskeletal
   Injuries
SO ADVANCES IN THERAPY
AB Introduction: A combination of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with real-time highresolution ultrasound (US) known as fusion imaging may improve visualization of musculoskeletal (MSK) sports medicine injuries. The aim of this study was to evaluate the applicability of MRI-US fusion technology in MSK sports medicine. Methods: This study was conducted by the medical services of the FC Barcelona. The participants included volunteers and referred athletes with symptomatic and asymptomatic MSK injuries. All cases underwent MRI which was loaded into the US system for manual registration on the live US image and fusion imaging examination. After every test, an evaluation form was completed in terms of advantages, disadvantages, and anatomic fusion landmarks. Results: From November 2014 to March 2015, we evaluated 20 subjects who underwent fusion imaging, 5 non-injured volunteers and 15 injured athletes, 11 symptomatic and 4 asymptomatic, age range 16-50 years, mean 22. We describe some of the anatomic landmarks used to guide fusion in different regions. This technology allowed us to examine muscle and tendon injuries simultaneously in US and MRI, and the correlation of both techniques, especially low-grade muscular injuries. This has also helped compensate for the limited field of view with US. It improves spatial orientation of cartilage, labrum and meniscal injuries. However, a high-quality MRI image is essential in achieving an adequate fusion image, and 3D sequences need to be added in MRI protocols to improve navigation. Conclusion: The combination of real-time MRI and US image fusion and navigation is relatively easy to perform and is helping to improve understanding of MSK injuries. However, it requires specific skills in MSK imaging and still needs further research in sports-related injuries.

TI Paralympic Sports Medicine-Current Evidence in Winter Sport:
   Considerations in the Development of Equipment Standards for Paralympic
   Athletes
SO CLINICAL JOURNAL OF SPORT MEDICINE
AB Objective: To highlight and discuss the considerations for the future development of equipment standards for Winter Paralympic sports.
   Data Sources: Literature searches were performed (in English) during May 2011 using the key words "technology, winter sport, Olympic, and Paralympic" in the computerized databases PubMed, PsycINFO, Science Direct, and Google Scholar. In addition, personal scientific observations were made at several Winter Paralympic Games. The retrieved articles were screened and assessed for relevance to the biological, biomechanical, and sport medicine aspects of equipment.
   Main Results: There are 3 key areas in which technology has influenced sports performance in Paralympic winter sports, namely, specialized prostheses, crutch skis or outriggers (in lieu of poles), and sport-specific wheelchairs (such as the sit-ski). From a sport medicine perspective, a crucial factor not considered in the standard laboratory test of mechanical efficiency is the influence of the human-equipment connection, such as the stump-to-prosthesis interface or the required human-to-wheelchair control. This connectivity is critical to the effective operation of the assistive device. When assessing the efficiency of this equipment, the not-so-obvious, holistic, compensatory factors need to be considered.
   Conclusions: Assistive equipment is fundamental for a person with a disability to participate and compete in winter sport activities. Although there have been improvements in the mechanical function of some assistive devices, the key issue is matching the residual function of the person with the assistive equipment. Equitable access to this technology will also ensure that the fundamental spirit of fair. play that underpins the Paralympic Games is maintained.

TI Cognitive research and new technologies in sport
SO VOPROSY PSIKHOLOGII
AB In this overview article the authors consider practical perspectives and still unresolved problem on the way towards application in sport of three new technologies stemmed from contemporary psychological and neurophysiological research. The first of them is the technology of eye-tracking (i.e. registration of eye movements), which is increasingly used for controlling and correcting attention and visual perception in sportsmen and their trainers. The second technology consists in creating artificial -virtual- environments for training as well as for competitions in such emerging fields as cyberpsychology and e-Sport. Finally, the third technology is about to realize a neurobiocontrol of sportsmen's functional state on the base of methods for analysis of brain electrophysiological activity. As these three technologies are completely non-invasive they are all-around accepted alternatives to the use of chemical substances that may well improve human resilience and complex skill learning in sport but are prohibited by national and international antidoping laws. Still unresolved problems of their application are analyzed. Two such problems are, first, the necessity of interrupting the continuous activity in eye-tracking to recalibrate the measurement instruments and, second, an underestimation of spatial depth as well as insufficient supply of sensors and actuators for producing somatosensory and vestibular sensations in the virtual reality systems. In the field of neurobiocontrol, the paradox behavior of the EEG alpha rhythm in shouting is discussed: the rhythm is suppressed during aiming in beginners but is disinhibited in the sportsmen of highest qualification. The authors tentatively explain this phenomenon and argue for a strictly individual approach in using these high-tech instruments.

TI APPLICATION OF NONLINEAR DYNAMIC SYSTEM AND TECHNOLOGY IN MOVING TARGET
   DETECTION DURING SPORTS TRAINING
SO FRACTALS-COMPLEX GEOMETRY PATTERNS AND SCALING IN NATURE AND SOCIETY
AB The aim of this paper is to improve the accurate analysis of the sports training project, research its video data profoundly, and discover deficiencies and summarize experience from the existing videos, thereby promoting China's sports industry. According to previous works, the existing sports training target detection system has the problem of nonlinear video and low target detection accuracy, which can easily cause target loss or tracking failure. Therefore, the Kalman Filter (KF) is studied in-depth and applied to detect the targets in sports videos. Combined with the Multi-Innovation (MI) theory, an MI-Extended KF (EKF) algorithm model based on nonlinear dynamic technology is proposed. This model can effectively solve the filtering accuracy problem under the strong nonlinear system. Finally, the performance analysis through different datasets has verified the effectiveness of the model proposed further. Results demonstrate that the model proposed can effectively improve the filtering accuracy of nonlinear systems. As the angle module changes, the accuracy of sports recognition also changes. The final accuracy of the model proposed can reach above 96%. The simulation results and convergence are better than other algorithms, which also proves the effectiveness of the model proposed. The results can provide a theoretical basis for the research related to the detection of training sports targets in sports videos.

AB Sports monitoring technologies such as wireless sensor packages offer greater insight into the performance of athletes. The costs and complexities associated with these technologies can be prohibitive, particularly to sub-elite and amateur groups. Smartphones are a cheaper, more familiar technology with adequate capabilities for capturing many sports related activities. This paper shows the feasibility of smartphones for use in a real-time monitoring environment for sports applications. Capture of sports related activities is conducted using both internal and external sensors and the data used to identify key features of a cricket bowler delivery. The effects of distance, antenna orientation and body occlusion on signal strength are tested and show that real-time data can be reliably transmitted up to 100 meters. The power use of commonly used smartphone subsystems is used to calculate the minimum duration of a typical monitoring application and show that the lifetime is suitable for many sports. The benefits and challenges of using smartphones for these applications is also discussed, including those faced when utilising these devices across larger groups for real-time monitoring of teams.

TI Application of Human Movement and Movement Scoring Technology in
   Computer Vision Feature in Sports Training
SO IETE JOURNAL OF RESEARCH
AB An important goal of computer vision research is to give computers human-like cognitive abilities so that the computer can recognize the environment in the visual field, understand the content of emotions, and take appropriate actions. Most of the information that people can perceive is obtained through vision. It is the human goal to make computers have the same visual functions as humans. At present, although computers do not have efficient, flexible, and intelligent human vision, with the joint efforts of researchers, people are gradually achieving their goals. The purpose of this thesis is to study the application of human movement and movement scoring technology in computer vision features in sports training. In this paper, the support vector machine (SVM) method is used to recognize the human movement in the video. After the recognition, the score is then performed, which can help sports athletes to carry out standardized training. The results of this paper show that the use of SVM method can basically achieve a recognition accuracy of more than 80% of human motion actions, so that motor actions can be scored better and more conveniently. Computer vision technology for action scoring can help athletes standardize various sports skills and improve their ability to compete by improving various sports skills.

SO BEHAVIOUR & INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
AB Both young adults and young elderly people have been found to be at a high risk of disengagement with physical activity. This makes both groups important targets for health and exercise promotion. Since sport and wellness technology has become popular among regular exercisers, it is worth studying how personal wellness devices could help both target groups in becoming more physically active. This study explores critical experiences during the implementation phase of a sport and wellness technology digital coach among young adults and young elderly. This qualitative study is based on a thematic analysis of 60 participants' interviews conducted with the critical incident technique. The study reveals the experiences the users consider crucial during the initial phases of usage of sport and wellness technology digital coaching devices. The results show that positive critical incidents among young adults and young elderly are similar when learning about personal health and exercising. However, the role of supportive communication seems to be more important with the young elderly people. Functionality and usability issues play a big role in negative critical incidents. The findings highlight the importance of these critical experiences to the overall usage experience and their influence on users' motivation to improve their fitness.

TI Analysis of Elite Sports Development Patterns through Sports Education
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EDUCATION IN MATHEMATICS SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Elite sports are one of the keys to developing sports as enshrined in the Sports Law. In this law, sport is positioned as an instrument for national development. However, it is more dominated by the sports development paradigm, even though Indonesia's sports achievements have significantly developed in several international sports competitions. It is contributed through the coaching factor through sports training education from an early age under the auspices of sports education at the school level. However, the impact has not been able to influence other aspects of national development more broadly. It has become a gap between what is stated in the Sports Law and practice in the field. Therefore, this research aims to examine the implementation of elite sports policies as part of the Sports Law to realize development through sports. To achieve the objectives of this study, we designed eleven semi-structured interview indicators based on the essence of the elite sports section of the sports law. This study found that the implementation of applied elite sports policies was close to conformity with the sports law. However, on the other hand, there are still shortcomings and inequities in several aspects. Inequality in several aspects occurs due to a lack of understanding of the importance of the role of sport as an instrument of national development. Therefore, the government as a stakeholder must immediately act decisively to deal with the problems. The implications of this research can be considered for evaluating the implementation of policies that will be implemented in the future.

TI 'A small leap for disabled man': the athlete-led evolution of the sports
   wheelchair and adaptive sports
SO SPORT IN HISTORY
AB The history of the sporting wheelchair demonstrates that wheelchair athletes and non-disabled medical professionals - two distinct social groups as defined by the Social Construction of Technology - held different interpretations of wheelchair sport and technology, and their purpose. Originating as a form of rehabilitation, wheelchairs and wheelchair sport were once interpreted solely within the medical realm, resulting in restricted technical development for sporting wheelchairs due to concerns around user safety. Wheelchair athletes, however, adapted their equipment in resistance of medicalised rules, based on their reinterpretation of the technology and desire to advance wheelchair-based sports beyond the institution, legitimising technical innovation as a site of agency for disabled athletes. In doing so, the functionality and form of wheelchairs evolved, facilitating the creation of specialised, sport-specific wheelchairs, such as the basketball wheelchair and racing wheelchair. In response to this, the rules of these sports were altered, stabilising the athletes' interpretation of wheelchair technology as sporting devices, and wheelchair sport as elite competition.

Data were collected from 682 Chinese college freshmen. Results indicated that perceived usefulness (PU), perceived ease of use (PEU) and attitude towards technology (ATT) significantly influenced students' intention to use sports bracelets. Self-efficacy (SE) not only was positively associated with PU and PEU, but, more importantly, self-efficacy moderated the relationship between PEU and behavioural intention (BI), and also between ATT and BI marginally. The effects of SE towards BI were found to be more apparent for low PEU and ATT students. In the case of sports bracelets, gender was found to moderate the relationships between PU and BI, and BI increased with PU for males but remained unchanged for females. Implications were discussed.

SO ADCAIJ-ADVANCES IN DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING AND ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE
   JOURNAL
AB Elbow injuries, prevalent in various sports, significantly impact an athlete's performance and career longevity. Traditional rehabilitation methods, while effective to a degree, often miss the mark in terms of precision and personalised care. This gap necessitates a shift towards more sophisticated rehabilitation strategies. This study introduces a pioneering approach in elbow rehabilitation, utilising cutting-edge wearable tracking technologies along with the telerehabilitation paradigm. The focus is on increasing the precision and efficacy of rehabilitation processes. We developed a state-ofthe-art wearable device, equipped with sophisticated sensors, to accurately track elbow joint movements, including position, rotation, and flexion, in real-time. The device provides detailed data, allowing for nuanced diagnosis and effective monitoring during rehabilitation phases. This data is integrated into a specialised application, enabling comprehensive data analysis and the formulation of personalised rehabilitation plans with real-time feedback. The device demonstrated a notable improvement in the precision of monitoring and effectiveness of rehabilitation strategies, allowing the measurement of the range of motion (RoM) within an error of +/- 3 degrees. A comparative analysis with traditional methods revealed significant advancements in accuracy, adherence to prescribed rehabilitation regimens, and overall speed of recovery.

SO THERMAL SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING PROGRESS
AB With the development of sports training science and technology, the real-time monitoring of athletes' physical condition and training effect is becoming more and more important. As a non-contact measurement method, thermal radiation imaging technology can capture the changes of athletes' body surface temperature efficiently and in real time, and provide relevant information about physiological state and performance indicators. This paper discusses the application of thermal radiation imaging technology in sports training to help measure athletes' physical state and training effect, so as to provide scientific basis for improving training efficiency and reducing sports injuries. In this paper, the high resolution thermal imaging equipment is used to systematically analyze the thermal radiation imaging of athletes, and the physiological index monitoring and data processing technology are combined to dynamically observe the temperature distribution and change characteristics of athletes under different training states. Through comparative analysis, the correlation between the data provided by thermal radiation imaging technology in the training process and the traditional physiological indicators was evaluated. The results show that thermal radiation imaging technology can effectively reflect the heat distribution and local body temperature changes of athletes during training. Compared to traditional physiological feedback data, the technology has significant advantages in quickly identifying excessive fatigue and potential injuries in athletes, especially during high-intensity training, and can provide early warning of associated risks. The application of sensor-assisted measurement system will further enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of sports scientific research and provide important support for athletes' scientific training and health management.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENGINEERING EDUCATION
AB This paper provides an overview of the development and implementation of a three-year industrially supported Sports Technology Bachelor Degree Programme (with an optional placement year in industry) from within the School of Mechanical and Manufacturing Engineering at Loughborough University, UK. The paper describes how engagement between course providers, industry and students has been encouraged and integrated into the curriculum. It is highlighted that the degree programme has flourished as a direct result of the already strong research activities in this area. Attention is given to the structure and content of the programme, links and discussions held with the sporting goods industry and the aspirations and career destinations of students and graduates. We have initiated many industry activities and believe that this is a key factor in attracting increasing student numbers. Examples include, one-year student placements in industry, industry sponsorship of undergraduate projects, extensive donations of equipment for teaching purposes, ongoing input from a departmental industry advisory board and a programme steering group that includes senior industry, academic and sports governing body representatives. In addition, industry are involved directly in teaching which includes visiting lectures, site visits and factory tours. Emphasis is given to how the needs of industry have been accommodated and how industrial support was sought and subsequently integrated into the programme. Insights gained from student feedback forms are discussed It is hoped that the paper will be of interest to others operating similar programmes and perhaps more importantly to those currently considering how to work co-operatively with industry to enhance engineering education for undergraduate students.

TI Viewing Sports Online during the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Antecedent
   Effects of Social Presence on the Technology Acceptance Model
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 has posed several challenges to the sporting industry, caused by the change in behavior of sporting fans from purchasing event tickets to watching live broadcasts of events on the Internet. This study aims to gain a deeper understanding of fan behavior in this "new normal". It adopts a technology acceptance model (TAM) to explore the effects of social presence (SP) in the context of online viewing of professional sports. For this purpose, the authors conducted an online survey of viewers who watched NBA sports events on the Amazon Mechanical Turk website using the Together Mode feature of Microsoft Teams. We collected 209 valid questionnaires and performed a partial least squares structural equation modeling analysis. The results showed that the SP-TAM structural model has adequate predictive relevance, and SP has a statistically significant positive relationship with both perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness. The model was thus validated, contributing to the existing body of knowledge on emerging technologies such as the creation of a virtual audience in sports. The study's findings suggest that technology developers should focus on the effects of SP and emphasize practical functions to increase the use intention of sporting fans. Furthermore, professional sporting leagues should prioritize the use of virtual fan technology to optimize the viewing experience of their fans.

AB The relationships between sport, motor activities, new technologies and disabilities within the educational environment is to be considered a relatively unexplored area of research. Movement activities combined with technologies provide an original area of pupil enhancement, as they guarantee opportunities and participation also for pupils with psychophysical and sensory difficulties. Primary school, in particular, has worked a really inclusive-didactic laboratory in recent decades; due to its educational specificity, it has experimented with itineraries of inclusion that have capitalized on the bodily-kinesthetic dimension of students. Inclusive didactics that use the resources of motor activity and technology is able to enhance and enrich the entire teaching-learning process, thanks to the methodology based mainly on cooperation and socialisation. Specifically, didactics, cooperation and socialization interface and generate an inclusive knowledge which, through multidisciplinary and multilateral motor games and through technology, defines the so-called motor-techno-games. The work helps to build an interdisciplinary epistemological framework of the educational side of motor and sports activity which, by investigating the relationship between body, movement and learning processes, highlights the bodily-kinesthetic dimension within the processes of knowledge construction. Furthermore, it detects the educational, training and integrative potential of teaching practice aimed at enhancing motor and sporting activities also in their adapted form. Reference is made to a fact-finding investigation, realized within a research-training experience at the ForPsiCom Department of the University of Bari. The study, started in 2022 and still in progress, focuses on the perception of disability and on the use of two technological systems integrated in teaching practice. The first results are presented.

   Australian state sporting association
SO MANAGING SPORT AND LEISURE
AB Purpose: The purpose of this exploratory study is to provide new insights into the benefits of, and barriers to, adoption and use of technology at an organisational level in not-for-profit sport.
   Research methods: A qualitative, case study methodology investigates the adoption and use of technology within an Australian state sporting association. Organisational documents and semi-structured interviews with the CEO and top-level managers were analysed through Rogers' diffusion of innovation theory.
   Results and findings: Key benefits include increases to productivity, enhanced communication, and remote working arrangements. Key barriers include the costs of adoption decisions (both financial and organisational); the capability of staff and other stakeholders to utilise complex technologies; and the impact of social systems and organisational norms.
   Implications: The adoption and use of technology enhances business operations, which in turn allows staff to improve their provision of sport. However, balancing the technologies needed to deliver sport to multiple stakeholders against those required for business operations is difficult and is impacted by resource constraints. Overcoming these barriers within not-for-profit sport organisations may lead to improved organisational efficiencies and apposite return on public funding.
   Research contribution: This study adds to our knowledge of the benefits and barriers of technology adoption and use at an organisational level within the not-for-profit sport sector.

AB Objective: In competitive sports, one of the most effective ways to improve athletes' competitive level is intensive training. The current training pro-cess is mainly based on the coach's existing experience and the athlete's personal physical condition to formulate a training plan, but the formulation of this training plan obviously lacks scientific basis. This paper combines data mining technology and image recognition tech-nology to construct a sports training system. In order to better deal with the over-dispersed and multi-peak count data, this paper proposes a mixed integer generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity model. The model uses virtual reality technology to construct train-ing scenes to improve athletes' training immersion, and can use digital technology to identify sports training processes, correct actions, and improve sports training effects. Finally, this article combines with experimental research to verify the training effect of the system con-structed in this article.

TI Fan involvement in a professional sport team's decision making
SO SPORT BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB Purpose - In an era where a growing segment of fantasy league participating and video game playing sport consumers has become more interested in managing individual major league players than in following the fortunes of actual major league teams, North American major league attendance is dropping. The authors aim to argue that team management could keep their attention, strengthen the team-fan bond, and increase attendance and overall revenue, by giving their fans input into decisions related to the team's on-field, on-court, or on-ice management.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper chronicles the rise of fantasy sport and sport video game participation and argues that a new breed of sport consumer is emerging that values managing sport over spectating. Previous attempts by teams to give fans input into management decisions are outlined and critiqued.
   Findings - It is suggested that teams wishing to increase the team identification and attendance frequency of these management-centric consumers should use technology to establish a platform whereby dues-paying members vote on team-related management issues. Utilizing a members-only webpage for some votes will encourage the growth of a geographically diverse fan base, while utilizing in-stadium hand-held wireless technology for other votes will encourage game attendance.
   Originality/value - This paper has value to marketers of professional sport who are constantly searching for ways to increase fan identification and sell tickets. It also has value to sport fan academics by suggesting that traditional conceptualizations of the team-fan bond may be becoming outdated in an era where a new generation of sport consumers is becoming increasingly player-focused and management-centric.

This study introduces MXene with conductive material and melamine sponge as substrate (MMSS, a type of FPPS) designed as a detection device to evaluate tennis performance. The device assesses four sports skills (forehand, backhand, serve, and volley) for elite and intermediate players during training and competition. Four indicators related to grip pressure exerted on the handle (T-1: time difference between pressure occurrence and backswing time of lead racket, T-2: time difference between pressure disappearance and end time of follow-through, T-3: pressure duration time, I: pressure peak) are collected, analyzed, and identified by AI. Significant differences in T-1, T-2, and T-3 are observed between intermediate and elite groups (P < 0.05), while I showed no significant difference (P > 0.05). The AI recognition accuracy for the elite group in training and competition is 97.49%. The device demonstrates that improved sports performance corresponds to shorter force exertion time in a single hit, and greater flexibility in grip strength and hand relaxation in various situations. This research offers a new perspective for evaluating sports performance in hand-held equipment, events, and presents a feasible direction for addressing challenges in flexible wearable technology in practice.

TI Exploring Inertial-Based Wearable Technologies for Objective Monitoring
   in Sports-Related Concussion: A Single-Participant Report
SO PHYSICAL THERAPY
AB Objective Challenges remain in sports-related concussion (SRC) assessment to better inform return to play. Reliance on self-reported symptoms within the Sports Concussion Assessment Tool means that there are limited data on the effectiveness of novel methods to assess a player's readiness to return to play. Digital methods such as wearable technologies may augment traditional SRC assessment and improve objectivity in making decisions regarding return to play. Methods The participant was a male university athlete who had a recent history of SRC. The single-participant design consisted of baseline laboratory testing immediately after SRC, free-living monitoring, and follow-up supervised testing after 2 months. The primary outcome measures were from traditional assessment (eg, Sports Concussion Assessment Tool and 2-minute instrumented walk/gait test; secondary outcome measures were from remote (free-living) assessment with a single wearable inertial measurement unit (eg, for gait and sleep). Results The university athlete (age = 20 years, height = 175 cm, weight = 77 kg [176.37 lb]) recovered and returned to play 20 days after SRC. Primary measures returned to baseline levels after 12 days. However, supervised (laboratory-based) wearable device assessment showed that gait impairments (increased step time) remained even after the athlete was cleared for return to play (2 months). Similarly, a 24-hour remote gait assessment showed changes in step time, step time variability, and step time asymmetry immediately after SRC and at return to play (1 month after SRC). Remote sleep analysis showed differences in sleep quality and disturbance (increased movement between immediately after SRC and once the athlete had returned to play [1 month after SRC]). Conclusion The concern about missed or delayed SRC diagnosis is growing, but methods to objectively monitor return to play after concussion are still lacking. This report showed that wearable device assessment offers additional objective data for use in monitoring players who have SRC. This work could better inform SRC assessment and return-to-play protocols. Impact Digital technologies such as wearable technologies can yield additional data that traditional self-report approaches cannot. Combining data from nondigital (traditional) and digital (wearable) methods may augment SRC assessment for improved return-to-play decisions. Lay Summary Inertia-based wearable technologies (eg, accelerometers) may be useful to help augment traditional, self-report approaches to sports-related concussion assessment and management by better informing return-to-play protocols.

SO JOURNAL OF URBAN TECHNOLOGY
AB Digitalization management, sports education, tourism and smart urban technologies are crucial for urban energy systems and environmental sustainability. Environmental sustainability is a critical global challenge, and countries emphasize combating the rising environmental issues. Undoubtedly, the globe has proposed several initiatives to address rising ecological matters, but the problem remains intact. This study shows a new pattern, including problems and vital solutions with fresh insights. Despite countries launching initiatives to combat environmental degradation (ED), ecological concerns continue to persist. Empirical research has considered income, urbanization, digitization, sports employment, tourism, and green energy as core sustainability determinants in selected European economies (2010-2021). Applying a series of estimators, we determined that income, urbanization, sports, and tourism are the leading causes of ED, while digitization and green energy contribute significantly to sustainable development. Additionally, digitization plays a significant mediating role in sustaining urban energy systems. The study offers helpful implications for achieving desired sustainability levels.

TI Eye tracking technology in sports-related concussion: a systematic
   review and meta-analysis
SO PHYSIOLOGICAL MEASUREMENT
AB Objective: The development of objective quantitative tools for the assessment and monitoring of sports-related concussion is critical. Eye tracking is a novel tool that may provide suitable metrics. The aim of this review was to appraise current evidence for the use of eye tracking technology in sports-related concussion assessment and monitoring. Approach: A systematic literature review was conducted following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. A search was run using Google Scholar, Microsoft Academic and PubMed for literature published between January 1980 and May 2018. Included were empirical research studies in English where at least 50% of the research participants were athletes, the participants were individuals with a diagnosis of concussion, and eye movements were measured using an eye tracking device. Main results: This systematic review integrates 21 publications on sports-related concussion and eye tracking technology, nine of which also qualified for the meta-analysis. Overall, the literature reported significant findings for variables in each of the four classes of eye tracking measurements (movement, position, count, and latency). Meta-comparison was made for seven variables for the acute concussions (the difference between the concussed and the control groups was significant for all of them) and one variable for the latent concussions (the difference was not significant). Significance: Most saccadic and pursuit deficits may be missed during clinical examination, and therefore eye tracking technology may be a useful and sensitive screening and monitoring tool for sports-related concussions. The inconsistencies between the eye movement metrics and methodology still make inferences challenging; however, using tasks that are closely related to brain areas involved in executive functions (such as memory-based saccade or antisaccade tasks) in the acute injury phase holds promise in differentiating between athletes who have a concussion compared to those who do not.

SO SYSTEMS
AB Integrated information systems in sports have the potential to improve the efficiency of data management and support the managers' decision-making. However, this implementation faces challenges such as inefficiency, data duplicity, and time demands. This study represents a comparative analysis of sports information systems' implementation in four countries-Slovakia, Czech Republic, England, and Denmark. The originality of this study stems from the fact that there is currently no research background examining this issue to the same extent. This study's methodology focuses on the identification of the benefits and challenges occurring while implementing sports information systems and performing data management and analysis. This study also focuses on the potential of these systems to support managerial decision-making in this area. Data were collected from national sports databases and other relevant sources. Verification of the hypotheses showed that the implementation of sports information systems in Slovakia is inefficient in terms of costs and technology. Nevertheless, the systems that were implemented support managerial decision-making and their success is comparable to other EU countries within the aspects studied. Following the results, the main recommendation is to ensure transparency, automation, and strategic planning in the implementation of sports information systems. Future research directions include ethical and legal issues related to the utilization of technology in sports and the improvement of the user experience.

TI Exploring the Role of Wearable Technology in Sport Kinematics and
   Kinetics: A Systematic Review
SO SENSORS
AB The aim of this review was to understand the use of wearable technology in sport in order to enhance performance and prevent injury. Understanding sports biomechanics is important for injury prevention and performance enhancement and is traditionally assessed using optical motion capture. However, such approaches are limited by capture volume restricting assessment to a laboratory environment, a factor that can be overcome by wearable technology. A systematic search was carried out across seven databases where wearable technology was employed to assess kinetic and kinematic variables in sport. Articles were excluded if they focused on sensor design and did not measure kinetic or kinematic variables or apply the technology on targeted participants. A total of 33 articles were included for full-text analysis where participants took part in a sport and performed dynamic movements relating to performance monitored by wearable technologies. Inertial measurement units, flex sensors and magnetic field and angular rate sensors were among the devices used in over 15 sports to quantify motion. Wearable technology usage is still in an exploratory phase, but there is potential for this technology to positively influence coaching practice and athletes' technique.

TI SPORTS AND SPORTS CULTURE OF STUDENTS IN HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
AB Currently, the strategic direction of the development of society and the system of education is the formation of human culture. The entry into force of the Bologna process aims to enhance the mobility of the individual, its development in the development of cultural values. A specific component of culture as a social phenomenon is sports - amateur, professional and mass. Sport is regarded as a sphere of public life which helps to form and develop best human qualities. A social necessity for the development of sports in the students' environment is determined by the needs of the society and the state to have an effective means of evolution of psycho-physical abilities of the person. Sport is one of the most effective and attractive forms of organization of physical culture of students becoming part of their life style. However, for sport to have only a positive impact on the person and not to cause their deformations, it is necessary to develop the sports culture of students in the process of physical culture and sports education. In our opinion, sports culture of the person is an integrative personal formation including a system of means, ways and results of physical culture and sports activities, focused on the perception, reproduction, creation and distribution of physical culture and sports values and technologies. Sports culture of the person is formed in the process of the person's acquisition of the cultural and educational potential, values and technologies of sports, as well as in the result of accumulation of experience of physical culture and sports activities and filling them with personal senses. Sports culture of the person includes the following components: 1. Component values (physical culture and sports values, meanings, motives, goals, means to achieve them). 2. The normative component of sports culture (norms of physical development, preparation, health, moral sports behavior, physical culture and sports traditions). 3. Socio-communicative component of sports culture (the culture of communication and interaction in the process of physical culture and sports activities). 4. The cognitive component of sports culture (physical culture and sports values in the form of knowledge, beliefs, skills). In the system of higher education it is necessary to implement the humanistic function of physical culture and sports and their impact on the person. In order to better implement the humanistic potential of physical culture and sports it is necessary to create the system of teaching physical culture and sports to students with a focus on the formation of the sports culture of the person.

AB The sports industry wields a direct and significant impact on the natural environment, with human activities having wrought considerable damage and contributed to climate change over the years. The urgency of addressing climate change has become undeniable, and the responsibility rests with sports enthusiasts to mitigate its harmful effects. Central to this endeavor is the dissemination of awareness about sustainable practices within the sports sector. Accordingly, two research questions are posed: What key aspects do sports organizations prioritize concerning climate change? And what role do digital technologies play in promoting sustainability in the context of climate change? The Sports for Climate Action (S4CA) framework outlines the fundamental principles and goals necessary for achieving ecological sustainability through sports. As a case study, this paper presents a comprehensive analysis of 22,647 tweets collected over two years, contributed by 14,354 unique-verified Twitter users. The resulting content and statistical analyses underscore the pivotal role of pro-environmental practices in the quest for sustainability within the realm of sports. Twitter users actively share information about athletes, sports events, leagues, products, and business classifications, all within the context of sports ecology. Notably, these discussions emphasize the integration of digital technologies such as artificial intelligence techniques, blockchain, and the Internet of Things, as the means to construct intelligent solutions for sports management practices.

AB Racket game variants like Frescobol, Matkot, etc. are quite popular in many countries with beaches all over the world. In Greece the name of this newly born sport is Beach-Racket and it was recognized as an official sport in 2014. Key steps in its evolution were the introduction of a high-tech score measuring system, mobiXeyes, developed by Mobics S.A., a spin-off company of University of Athens. In this work we describe the basic rules of Beach-Racket and the technology adopted for fulfilling the requirements imposed by the sport. The system is based on two high frame rate cameras and implements a stereoscopic method to calculate the speed of a ball in every hit. Apart from this, it offers a GUI interface for setup, player and category management, calculation of statistics etc. The system in general can calculate the 3D position and the speed of a fast moving object and could be used also in a wide range of relevant sports with none or minor modifications.

TI Examining the Influence of Sports Appreciation on Sports Engagement and
   Behaviors: The Moderating Role of Sport Type among Taiwanese Pupils
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB This study examines the impact of sports participation and appreciation on sports identification and engagement with sports spectatorship with the sport type as a moderator through a perspective of the social and emotional development of elementary school students in Taiwan. This research specifically explores the influence of baseball and badminton activities on students' engagement and connection with sports. An experimental design, supplemented with questionnaires, was utilized, involving 111 students from middle and upper grades who either participated in a recreational sports camp or did not. This study aimed to uncover quasi-causal relationships among active sports participation, personal identification with sports, and spectator behaviors. Pre- and post-camp surveys indicated that participation in sports camps significantly enhanced sports identification and interest in spectating, particularly in baseball, because of more frequent viewing opportunities. The findings highlight the importance of the type of sport and the level of identification with it in sustaining an ongoing interest in sports spectatorship. Interestingly, introducing spectatorship at badminton camps resulted in decreased sports identification and engagement intentions, suggesting that programs must be tailored to developmental needs and meet the abilities of young learners to be effective.

AB Introduction: This study reviewed relevant scholarly literature to identify the relationship between high technology and competitive sports, and make sure high-tech helps improve performance by setting new records, however, too much high-tech may raise concerns and been thought as a way of breaking rules. Methodology: This study reviewed relevant scholarly literature to identify how high-tech works in c competitive sports. Peer-reviewed research papers were identified through Elsevier, Science Direct and ERIC. Results: This paper considers two specific areas high technologies have made to competitive sports. (1) supportive effect of how advanced technology improve athletes' performance in competition in sports events of swimming, track and field and so on; and (2) negative effects: how hi-tech raise dispute, and cause ethical dilemmas or been recognized as technology doping. Examples are used to illustrate the variety of applications in which advanced technology has been used successfully and the benefits which have resulted from its use. Conclusions: High technology and innovative devices have been commonly used and performance-enhancing technology can give an athlete a decisive competitive edge. However, an athlete cannot win on talent along. So technology must be used or handled properly to serve as a "tool" in competitive sports pools and fields; technology can only play an aid or assistance role but a controller role in everyday training and competition; do not let competitions be dictated by one technology over another..

   technology in the COVID-19 pandemic
SO INTERNATIONAL REVIEW FOR THE SOCIOLOGY OF SPORT
AB The aim of this paper was to photograph this precise moment in history, focusing on the situation of older adults during the COVID-19 health emergency in Northern Italy. In particular, we analysed the relationship between social networks and social support, sport and recreational activity, and the use of communications technologies in December 2020. We investigated and discussed such use of technologies, wondering if and how it helped to compensate for the diminishment in social health, usually gained trough social interactions and the practice of sport and physical activity. We examined how reduction of mobility, social distancing and isolation measures imposed by the government to reduce the spread of COVID-19, affected the living conditions of the older adults, in particular their social health, and the level of sport and physical activity they were engaged in. We collected data through interviews with the subjects, assessing their social networks, the perceived social support provided by their family members, friends and caregivers, and the level of sport and physical activity they were engaged in. Moreover, we analysed the impact of technological communications devices, which were employed to help older adults to maintain their relationships with the outside world and to preserve their active life. The interview questions were formulated based on the Lubben Social Network Scale-Revised (LSNS-R), the short version of the Social Support List (SSL12-I) for the elderly and the Physical Activity Scale for the Elderly (PASE). A relationship was found between the social health related to physical activity of the older adults subjects during the COVID-19 emergency and the use of communications technologies, which played a role in mitigating the impact of the crisis on their social health by helping them to keep physically and socially active.

AB Sports spaces are being increasingly used for enabling a variety of computing education opportunities. This work often aims to support socially and disciplinarily minoritized communities, often children of color with specific cultural practices and identities around sports. In this work, we focus on how these experiences can be extended to support youth in developing lasting long term skills around computational making using athletic interest and participation as a jumping off point. We focus on how such a making process can enhance and augment learners' sports understanding, and by extension sports performance; as well as how their sports interest helps them encounter and make sense of different computing concepts. In this paper, we discuss working with a student athlete, his journey of designing and bringing to life ideas around sports technologies, through physical computing and prototyping technologies. We employed a user-centered design approach for designing the learning experience, and emerging methods for assessing learning in making experiences. We blend data around his making experience with observations and interview data around his sports experiences. We find that the process of making augmented his ability to think more deeply about elements of his practice (e.g., strategies of play, ecosystem, and teamwork) and a deeper appreciation of science and technology in the real world. This work contributes an additional lens on how making can serve as a powerful process to realize new possibilities involving computing education in cultural-sustaining computing learning environments.

TI From Metrics to Experiences: Investigating How Sport Data Shapes the
   Social Context, Self-Determination and Motivation of Athletes
SO INTERACTING WITH COMPUTERS
AB In this paper, we use self-determination theory and its related mini-theories to investigate the influence of sport data on sports experience and motivation in sports. First, we reflect on the use of technology in sports and show how sport data thwarts and promotes motivation in sports. Second, we argue that human-computer interaction (HCI) has been too narrowly focused on the 'performance' aspect of sport data. We argue for a more liberal take on sport data, showing that it also relates to motivation in sports through basic human needs. By bridging SportsHCI studies with the insights we gain from self-determination theory, we uncover the interwoven relations between the objective measures that sports technology provides and their motivational aspects for athletes. Our paper ends with five emerging points for attention for SportsHCI that we think can pave the way towards a more holistic approach to considering sport data for motivation in sports.

AB Purpose
   This study examined the effect of the use of ITCs in the ability of perception and analysis competitive situations by university students of basketball, handball and athletics.
   Methods
   Fifty-six students from the Faculty of Physical Activity and Sport (U.P.M.) belonging to High Performance Sports course formed the sample. We carried out an analysis of the evolution of perception and analysis of three groups of students highly educated in sports: athletics (G1, n = 17), handball (G2, n = 21) and basketball (G3, n = 18). All of them learned with a teaching methodology common with frequent and active use of ICTs where classes are taught using media. Students have access to content through a virtual platform and had to do homework and weekly assignments related to new technologies. The three groups were evaluated at the beginning (T1) and end (T2) of the course, following the methodological process by a specific audiovisual test for each subject. The tests measured the ability of perception and analysis of the students.
   Results
   The results confirmed a significant improvement during the course (T1-T2 = -2.27, p <0.01, df = 17, t =- 7.087) in the three groups. Students in team sports improved greater than athletics. In handball the greatest differences were observed (T1-T2 = -4.43 +/- 1.88, P <0.01, df = 20, t =- 10.76) between the average initial test (3.05 +/- 1, 49) and final test (7.47 +/- 1.57). In basketball, the final average (7.05 1.12) was similar to the previous one but the fact that the average initial test (4.77 +/- 1.04) was higher means that the differences were lower (T1 -T2 = -2.27 +/- 1.36, p <0.01, df = 17, t =- 7.087). While in athletics, the average initial test (4.74 +/- 1.71) and final test (6.17 +/- 1.95) was lower but the differences were equally significant (T1-T2 = - 1.44 +/- 0.84, p <0.01, df = 16, t = -11.973).
   Conclusions
   It could be argued that the frequent and active use of new technologies has a positive impact on improving the ability to appreciate and analysis of sports.

TI Sports Participation and Value of Elite Sports in Predicting Well-Being
SO SPORTS
AB This work contributes to an emerging literature focused on the role of physical activity on the subjective well-being of populations. Unlike the existing literature, it proposes an approach that uses algorithms to predict subjective well-being. The aims of this study were to determine the relative importance of sports participation and perceived value of elite sports on the subjective well-being of individuals. A total of 511 participants completed an online questionnaire. The statistical analysis used several machine learning techniques, including three algorithms, Decision Tree Classifier (DTC), Random Forest Classifier (RFC), and Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC). In the three algorithms tested, sports participation, expressed as the weekly frequency and the time spent engaging in vigorous physical activity, showed a greater importance (between 47% and 53%) in determining subjective well-being. It also highlights the effect of perceived value of elite sport on the prediction of subjective well-being. This study provides evidence for public sport policy makers/authorities and for managers of physical activity and sport development programs. The surprising effect of the perceived value of elite sport on the prediction of subjective well-being.

TI Self-efficacy and trust in consumers' use of health-technologies devices
   for sports
SO HELIYON
AB The commercial market for wearable health technology is growing but the value these technologies provide for consumers is debatable, as many technologies lack formal validation and are being abandoned at a high rate. The enabling of self-efficacy mechanisms in the design of health technologies, through the factors identified by self-determination theory and the Technology Acceptance Model, could increase the uptake and continued use of these devices. The aim of this research was to investigate how and why people use wearable health technology, and to evaluate their experiences from the perspective of perceptions of autonomy, safety, information security, information accuracy and willingness for continued use. Forty-eight sport enthusiasts or athletes, age range 18-65 and over, completed an online survey with 46 questions. A statistical analysis that included a Mann-Whitney U Test and a Person's Correlation analysis indicated that participants who were confident in their use of a health technology showed satisfaction with previous uses and a sense of autonomy leading to an overall positive experience. Issues around data and personal information security were identified, aligning with extant literature. Findings suggest that: (i) past experience play a role in people's perception of self-efficacy, (ii) the tracking of activities enables of autonomy and confidence, (iii) autonomy influences personal willingness to use health technologies, (iv) strong interest in personal health technologies motivates sustained engagement, and that (v) reliability and validity of data impacts on confidence in health technologies. A conceptual model is proposed for consideration when designing and evaluating health technologies, based on the factors supporting self-efficacy and trust in health technologies. Further research is required to develop this model with the aim of informing designers and developers about how to translate these factors into design features for the development of more effective personal health technology.

AB Dawson, L, McErlain-Naylor, SA, Devereux, G, and Beato, M. Practitioner usage, applications, and understanding of wearable GPS and accelerometer technology in team sports. J Strength Cond Res 38(7): e373-e382, 2024-Monitoring training load is essential for optimizing the performance of athletes, allowing practitioners to assess training programs, monitor athlete progress, and minimize the risk of injury and overtraining. However, there is no universal method for training load monitoring, and the adoption of wearable global positioning system (GPS) and accelerometer technology in team sports has increased the volume of data and, therefore, the number of possible approaches. This survey investigated the usage, applications, and understanding of this technology by team sports practitioners. Seventy-two practitioners involved in team and athlete performance monitoring using GPS and accelerometer technology completed the survey. All respondents reported supporting the use of GPS technology in their sport, with 70.8% feeling that GPS technology is important for success. Results showed that 87.5% of respondents use data from wearable technology to inform training prescription, although only 50% use the data to influence decisions in competition. In addition, results showed that GPS metrics are used more than accelerometer-derived metrics; however, both are used regularly. Discrepancies in accelerometer usage highlighted concerns about practitioners' understanding of accelerometer-derived metrics. This survey gained insight into usage, application, understanding, practitioner needs, and concerns and criticisms surrounding the use of GPS and accelerometer metrics for athlete load monitoring. Such information can be used to improve the implementation of this technology in team sport monitoring and highlight gaps in the literature that will help to design future studies to support practitioner needs.

SO APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND NONLINEAR SCIENCES
AB Computer vision technology and video image processing technology in the visual rehearsal of sports dance is a hot research topic. Based on this research background, the thesis uses 3D mathematical modelling technology to interpolate and extract the captured sports and dance movement information to make the final synthesised human animation natural, smooth and lifelike. At the same time, the thesis realises the method of action cohesion through the definition of characteristic action unit attributes and association constraints. Then, it applies it to the visual rehearsal system of sports dance. Finally, the analysis of experimental results proves that the proposed method can improve the precision and recall of rehearsal.

TI The "Second Place" Problem: Assistive Technology in Sports and (Re)
   Constructing Normal
SO SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING ETHICS
AB Objections to the use of assistive technologies (such as prostheses) in elite sports are generally raised when the technology in question is perceived to afford the user a potentially "unfair advantage," when it is perceived as a threat to the purity of the sport, and/or when it is perceived as a precursor to a slippery slope toward undesirable changes in the sport. These objections rely on being able to quantify standards of "normal" within a sport so that changes attributed to the use of assistive technology can be judged as causing a significant deviation from some baseline standard. This holds athletes using assistive technologies accountable to standards that restrict their opportunities to achieve greatness, while athletes who do not use assistive technologies are able to push beyond the boundaries of these standards without moral scrutiny. This paper explores how constructions of fairness and "normality" impact athletes who use assistive technology to compete in a sporting venue traditionally populated with "able-bodied" competitors. It argues that the dynamic and obfuscated construction of "normal" standards in elite sports should move away from using body performance as the measuring stick of "normal," toward alternate forms of constructing norms such as defining, quantifying, and regulating the mechanical actions that constitute the critical components of a sport. Though framed within the context of elite sports, this paper can be interpreted more broadly to consider problems with defining "normal" bodies in a society in which technologies are constantly changing our abilities and expectations of what normal means.

TI THE INTEGRATION AND INNOVATION OF SPORTS SOCIAL PLATFORMS AND
   INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
SO SCALABLE COMPUTING-PRACTICE AND EXPERIENCE
AB In order to better achieve the integration and innovation of sports social platforms and information technology, the author proposes an SFD (Sport Friend Discover) sports friend recommendation model based on physical testing big data. The core idea of this model is to use physical measurement data to match the similarity between athletes and recommend suitable exercise partners. Specifically, we collected a large amount of physical measurement data, including height, weight, body fat percentage, muscle mass, etc. Then, through data mining algorithms, these data are transformed into feature vectors of the movers. Next, we use a similarity algorithm to calculate the similarity between different athletes and find the most matching motion partner with the user. The results show that the SFD method outperforms the other two traditional recommendation methods on the dataset, with P @ 10, P @ 20, P @ 30, and P @ 40 of SFD reaching 0.099, 0.095, 0.085, and 0.591, respectively. SFD not only utilizes more neighboring information than FOAF based on local graph structure, but also compared to TRW based on global graph structure method, at the same time, the importance of the node itself is also considered, resulting in higher accuracy. It has been proven that the SFD sports friend recommendation model based on physical testing big data has achieved good results in recommending sports partners. Users can quickly find sports partners with similar body types and health conditions, improving the fun and effectiveness of exercise.

TI The Role of Emergent Technologies in the Dynamic and Kinematic
   Assessment of Human Movement in Sport and Clinical Applications
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Physical activity analysis assessment has been a concern throughout human history. The intersection of technological growth with sports has given rise to a burgeoning field known as sports engineering. In the 19th century, the advent of chrono-photography and pioneering marked the inception of sports performance analysis. In recent years, the noticeable developments achieved in wearable low-power electronics with wireless high interconnection capability, as a part of modern technologies, have aided us in studying sports parameters such as motor behavior, biomechanics, equipment design, and materials science, playing an essential role in the understanding of sports dynamics. This study aims to review over 250 published articles since 2018, focusing on utilizing and validating these emergent technologies in sports and clinical aspects. It is predicted that one of the next steps in sports technology and engineering development will be using algorithms based on artificial intelligence to analyze the measurements obtained by multi-sensor systems (sensor fusion) to monitor biometric and physiological parameters in performance analysis and health assessments.

TI Introduction to Philosophical Issues in Sport Science
SO PHILOSOPHIES
AB The role and value of science within sport increases with ever greater professionalization and commercialization. Scientific and technological innovations are devised to increase performance, ensure greater accuracy of measurement and officiating, reduce risks of harm, enhance spectatorship and raise revenues. However, such innovations inevitably come up against epistemological and metaphysical problems related to the nature of sport and physical competition. This special issue identifies and explores key and contemporary philosophical issues in relation to the science of sport and exercise. The opening four chapters focus on the nature of scientific evidence, and causation in sport; the middle four chapters on the influence of science and technology and its relationship to sport officiating; whilst the final three chapters consider the way in which science affects the construction of sport. It brings together scholars working on philosophical problems in sport to examine issues related to the values and assumptions behind sport and exercise science, key problems that result, and provide recommendations for improving its practice.

   Applying the Extended Technology Acceptance Model (ETAM)
SO HEALTHCARE
AB Since the basic model of technology acceptance model (TAM) was introduced, studies in various fields have been conducted to improve the explanatory power of the TAM. These studies show that there are limitations in explaining the intention to use a new technology with just two variables (perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use), and that the intention to use a new technology can be affected by many external variables, in addition to the two variables. Accordingly, the purpose of this study is to identify factors affecting users' intention to participate in a virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) sports experience based on the extended technology acceptance model (ETAM). To this end, this study analyzed the results of a survey conducted on 300 university students who are sports majors in Korea, who have experienced VR/AR sports. First, among experience economy factors, education experience, escape experience, and esthetic experience had a positive effect on presence. Second, presence had a positive effect on perceived usefulness and flow. Third, perceived usefulness and flow had a positive effect on the intention to participate. This study has significance in empirically investigating the relationship among variables affecting users' intention to participate in a VR/AR sports experience using the ETAM. The results can be used as basic data for establishing strategies necessary in vitalizing VR/AR sports in the future.

The mechanism for sports injury is well defined and includes intrinsic (age, psychology etc.) and extrinsic risk factors (weather, training load etc.), and the inciting event. With the rise of machine learning (ML), a variety of ML techniques have been applied to various sports injury aspects. The purpose of this work is to assess the current applications of ML to sports injury and identify areas of growth by a systematic analysis of applications to each injury element: intrinsic factors, extrinsic factors, and the inciting event. Current underdeveloped areas are identified as: psychological effect, use of extrinsic factors, analysis of the inciting event, and application of the action recognition ability of videos and wearable technology. Future technical applications in these underdeveloped areas should be undergone to expand on and improve sports injury prevention technology.

TI Introducing esports coaching to sport coaching (not as sport coaching)
SO SPORTS COACHING REVIEW
AB The popularity of electronic sports (esports) has increased over the last decade, and knowledge has been shared between sports and esports. Yet, research on esports coaching remains conspicuously absent. From this position, sport coaching researchers and practitioners lack an evidenced base to inform their critical consideration of esports coaching. In response, this study describes the experiences and contexts of 14 head coaches in professional teams competing in "League of Legends". Analysis identified themes including; 1) uncodified career and education pathways for coaches; 2) coaches practice by a review-plan-do cycle shaped by the pressure to win; 3) coaches practice in a complex, technological and global environment; and 4) coaches practice amongst challenges and paradoxes. The findings present an original analysis of esports coaching and provide a platform for sport coaching researchers and practitioners to critically consider the relevance, development, practice and context of esports coaching in relation to their own work.

AB Practicing sports in the outdoors as a way to reduce stress levels, improve health and even as an incentive to enhance social relations, has encouraged more and more people to leave the sedentary lifestyle to perform activities like walking, jogging, hiking, biking, among others. This trend of practicing outdoor sport activities also was driven by new technological gadgets (e.g., smartphone whit special apps, fitness trackers and smartwatches) since they allow tracking all the workout performance values (e.g., pace, speed, distance, duration), vita parameters and signals (e.g., heart rate, temperature and calories burned) and also allow following the exercise route (e.g., geographic coordinates). During outdoors sports activities, independently if these are amateur or professional, the sportsman can suffer accidents, which can result in body injuries, or an unexpected health problem (e.g., heart attack, heatstroke and dehydration) that can limit its mobility or even its conscious state. When this happens, an emergency service should be activated. This is the more important the more remote is the site of the emergency. A solution envisaged to provide emergency care as soon as possible in cross-country sports competitions, even when the land topography is very rough, is proposed in this paper. The base idea is to use a drone that carries a first aid kit (bandages, alcohol, cotton, gauze, water, and other emergency and survival products) and has real-time audio and video communications capabilities.

   Psychology
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES IN LEARNING
AB Traditional teaching mode cannot meet the learning needs of students. Online learning technology is increasingly accepted and has gradually become an important teaching mode. However, most online learning systems cannot achieve the panoramic effect. Moreover, students cannot be personally on the scene, such that it is difficult for them to focus. Particularly, some abstract course contents cannot be well expounded, which results in low learning efficiency. Thus, this study constructed an online learning system based on panoramic technology for sport psychology. This system synchronously performs explanation process, voice, and course data. This system can also reach the teaching purpose of panoramic simulation of a real classroom. In addition, this system has strong applicability. The experiment proves that students who learn with this system improve significantly in terms of course interest, theoretical knowledge understanding and wish, and practical application.

AB The scientific analysis of athletes' training images in competitive sports training can effectively help improve the training effect. This paper carries out the analysis aimed at the image processing technology with the collected video images of sports; the images are filtered to obtain the preprocessed images, which are grayed up for the qualitative analysis. The processing of sports images requires real-time tracking of the athletes and the sports equipment. To solve the shortcomings of traditional algorithms, this paper proposes a nonlinear detection algorithm based on the research of current experts and scholars. The algorithm mainly determines the tracking object by measuring its boundary through the maximum and minimum value in the same pixel neighborhood. Finally, new training strategies can be developed on the basis of the data to enhance the skills of athletes.

TI Exploring the Adoption of Sports Brand Apps: An Application of the
   Modified Technology Acceptance Model
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ASIAN BUSINESS AND INFORMATION MANAGEMENT
AB The purpose of this article was to apply the modified technology acceptance model (TAM) to examine factors influencing consumers' intention and actual behavior in using sports brand apps. Convenience sampling was conducted for Korean consumers (N = 261) of sports brand apps. Data were analyzed by partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) using SmartPLS 3.0. The results found that the level of enjoyment had a significantly positive effect on the perceived ease of use, while perceived ease of use also positively affected perceived usefulness. Behavioral intention to use sports brand apps was most significantly influenced by perceived enjoyment, followed by perceived usefulness, and then perceived ease of use. Moreover, behavioral intention positively affected actual behavior. In addition, a multi-group analysis carried out found differences between three age groups (20s, 30s, and 40+) regarding the use of sports brand apps. The findings provide a better understanding of consumer behavior when using sports brand apps.

SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB The main aim of this research was to evaluate the impact of the implementation of Fitlight technology in the process of sports training and motor assessment on the improvement in agility and reactive agility of junior basketball players. The age groups studied were under-14 (U14) and under-16 (U16). This study included 70 male basketball athletes, structured in two experimental groups: U14 (18 subjects) and U16 (17 subjects); two control groups: U14 (18 subjects) and U16 (17 subjects). Arithmetic averages of the anthropometric characteristics of the subject groups: experimental group U14: height 172.89 cm, weight 58.22 kg, BMI 19.56; control group U14: height 165.44 cm, weight 50.17 kg, BMI 18.53; experimental group U16: height 179.94 cm, weight 70.82 kg, BMI 20.35; control group U16: height 183.88 cm, weight 73.41 kg, BMI 20.83. An 18-week experimental program that integrates Fitlight technology in order to develop coordination and agility skills and corrective agility was implemented in the experimental groups. This study included six tests: T agility test, T agility test with ball, reactive T agility test, reactive T agility test with ball, Illinois agility test, and Illinois agility test with ball. The results of this study showed statistically significant progress between the initial and final testing for the experimental group, p < 0.05. The Cohen's values of the experimental groups were above 0.8, which denotes a large effect size; for the control group, these sizes were small and medium. The comparative analysis of the experimental and control groups, U14 and U16, highlights significant statistical differences in favor of the experimental groups, for all the agility tests of this study. This study highlights the effectiveness of incorporating advanced training tools like Fitlight in sports training, particularly for young basketball players. This approach surpasses traditional methods in enhancing agility, suggesting a paradigm shift towards technology-integrated training in sports.

TI Electrochemical detection of caffeine in sports drinks based on
   molecular imprinting technology
SO JOURNAL OF FOOD MEASUREMENT AND CHARACTERIZATION
AB This work presents the development of a novel electrochemical sensor for caffeine detection in sports drinks, utilizing molecular imprinting technology with surface-imprinted nanoparticles. Key to this study is the synthesis of caffeine-imprinted polypyrrole nanoparticles via electropolymerization, which displayed a high specific surface area (25 m(2)/g) and efficient template binding. The sensor exhibited a notable linear detection range from 30 to 150 mu M and a significantly low limit of detection at 2.5 mu M. Characterization of the nanoparticles was rigorously conducted using SEM, FTIR, and BET analysis. Optimized sensing conditions were established at pH 5, with a 5 min accumulation time and a scan rate of 50 mV/s, ensuring high sensitivity and selectivity. Practical application was demonstrated through the accurate detection of caffeine in commercially available sports drinks, with recovery rates ranging from 97.6 to 101.5%. This research underscores the potential of molecularly imprinted polymer-based sensors in simplifying and enhancing the detection of caffeine in complex matrices, offering a promising tool for health monitoring and sports performance analysis.

AB Sport marketers have begun to adopt augmented reality (AR) in an effort to enhance the fan experience. Hence, there is a need to investigate fan perspectives of this new marketing tool. The current study investigated fans' perceptions AR activations within a sport setting. Findings indicated the visual appeal of AR is very influential on fans' intention to use an activation or provide positive word of mouth. While previous research in sport indicated the perceived ease of use of a technology to significantly influence consumers' attitudes toward a technology (Kim and Chiu, 2019), the current study utilized smartphones as the vehicle to provide the AR and ease of use was not found to be significant. Hence, marketers should note that smartphone based AR activations will likely be deemed relatively easy to use as most people are intimately familiar with their phone and there should be a significant focus on ensuring the AR is visually appealing.

TI Adaptive Sports Technology and Biomechanics: Wheelchairs
SO PM&R
AB Wheelchair sports are an important tool in the rehabilitation of people with severe chronic disabilities and have been a driving force for innovation in technology and practice. In this paper, we will present an overview of the adaptive technology used in Paralympic sports with a special focus on wheeled technology and the impact of design on performance (defined as achieving the greatest level of athletic ability and minimizing the risk of injury). Many advances in manual wheelchairs trace their origins to wheelchair sports. Features of wheelchairs that were used for racing and basketball 25 or more years ago have become integral to the manual wheelchairs that people now use every day; moreover, the current components used on ultralight wheelchairs also have benefitted from technological advances developed for sports wheelchairs. For example, the wheels now used on chairs for daily mobility incorporate many of the components first developed for sports chairs. Also, advances in manufacturing and the availability of aerospace materials have driven current wheelchair design and manufacture. Basic principles of sports wheelchair design are universal across sports and include fit; minimizing weight while maintaining high stiffness; minimizing rolling resistance; and optimizing the sports-specific design of the chair. However, a well-designed and fitted wheelchair is not sufficient for optimal sports performance: the athlete must be well trained, skilled, and use effective biomechanics because wheelchair athletes face some unique biomechanical challenges.

AB The difficulty of sports video detection technology lies in how to detect the end point segment from the complex video speech environment, and the artificial intelligence technology is still in the research stage. Based on this, this study builds a model based on the hidden Markov model. At the same time, the video file noise reduction processing is performed by the spectral subtraction noise reduction algorithm of the complex domain extension. Moreover, combined with the actual situation of sports competitions, this paper proposes an endpoint detection algorithm based on variance characteristics, and comprehensively designs a speech recognition model based on Markov model. In order to verify the validity of the model, the performance of the model is verified by an example, and the real sports competition is taken as the research object, and the accuracy rate and the recall rate are set as performance indicators. The research shows that the model proposed in this study performs well in both accuracy and performance rate and can be used as a reference for artificial intelligence application to sports video detection technology.

AB Since its inception, Blockchain Technology, the underlying technology of Bitcoin has gained a lot of popularity and interest in various industries, varying from the healthcare industry, Internet-of-Things, smart grid, and supply chain management. Sports is one industry where blockchain can have significant breakthroughs where it can reshape the way the sports industry works by providing reliable athlete data management, secure mechanisms for data sharing, reforming the event management practices, collectibles traceability, and many more, but so far its impact is overshadowed by the hype surrounding the use of fan tokens and Non-Fungible-Tokens (NFT) collectibles. This paper aims to provide a systematic review of the ongoing research on the application of blockchain in the sports industry. this work shows that many studies have proposed different use cases for the application of blockchain in the sports industry on and off the field and targeting different stakeholders. However, we inferred a lack of adequate prototype implementations to evaluate the effectiveness of these proposed use cases. We further highlighted the technical details of the implementation of these blockchain-based applications, their limitations, and challenges, and proposed some solutions to support the integration of blockchain in this domain. The findings of this work will be beneficial for researchers, policymakers, and practitioners in the sports industry.

TI Fans as e-participants? Utopia/dystopia visions for the future of
   digital sport fandom
SO CONVERGENCE-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF RESEARCH INTO NEW MEDIA
   TECHNOLOGIES
AB Media technologies and digital practices are reshaping and redefining the future of sport fandom. This article points to some of the utopian and dystopic transformations for fandom presented by (post)television, digital/social media and the anticipated virtual technologies of the future. Specifically, three distinct phases of fan participation are charted around existing and futuristic visions of technology-as-sport. First are the current televisual technologies that attempt to engage and retain traditionally "passive" viewers as spectators through pseudo-participatory perspectives that will carry over to new screens and technologies. Second, the assumed interactive participation afforded by social and digital media is considered, positing the future amplification of connectivity, personalisation and networking across digital fan communities, albeit undercut by further impositions of corporatisation and datafication through illusory forms of "interactivity". Finally, the fusion, intensification and continual evolution of technology-as-sport is explored, asserting that forms of immersive participation will be significant for future virtual technologies and may ultimately re-position fans as e-participants in their own media-tech sport spectacles. Collectively, it is anticipated that the creation of new virtual worlds, spaces and experiences will amplify and operationalise forms of immersive participation around augmented spectatorship, virtual athletic replication and potentially constitute the sport itself. Indeed, a new model of the fan-as-immersed-e-participant is advanced as such futuristic virtual sporting realms may not only integrate fans into the spectacle but also project them into the event as participant and as the spectacle.

TI Sport Experience Design: Wearable Fitness Technology in the Health and
   Fitness Industry
SO JOURNAL OF SPORT MANAGEMENT
AB Emerging technologies not only pose challenges for how sport organizations are managed but also create opportunities for sport organizations to become more competitive by enhancing consumers' service experience. The integration of wearable fitness technology (WFT) by health and fitness clubs provides an opportunity to examine the influence of WFT on the service experience. Although existing research on technology innovations typically examines either the individual or the organizational perspective in isolation, we use the sport experience design framework to comprehensively examine the influence of WFT on the management and perceptions of service experiences. Participants (N= 37) who took part in the qualitative study included fitness club owners (n = 13), fitness club instructors (n = 7), and fitness club members (n = 17). Findings indicate that integrating WFT enhances the service experience via increased social interaction, gamification, and accountability. However, findings also suggest that technology innovations must be integrated carefully to avoid misalignment between providers' and users' perceptions. Despite the potential for misalignment, emerging technologies can enhance and expand the service experience beyond the physical environment, presenting sport organizations with technology-mediated opportunities to engage consumers.

AB Over the last 15 years, we have witnessed a digitalization of the sports experience, i.e., many sports have been enhanced by digital and wearable devices. The centrality of the human body and the different contexts where sports can be practiced have led HCI research to explore how mobile and wearable devices could support the physical, social, and environmental aspects of sports disciplines. Yet, the field of HCI & sports continues to evolve under the push of new technological developments and events affecting people world-wide, such as the Covid-19 pandemic and climate change. Technological advancements like the metaverse, inbodied technologies, and AI have paved the way for augmented humans, esports, new forms of sociality, and new ways to engage the audience. Likewise, contextual factors push sports trends in two opposite directions simultaneously: on the one hand, they foster the indoorisation and individualization of sports; on the other hand, they encourage practicing sports outdoors and taking advantage of the "restorative environment" of nature. With this workshop, we would like to invite the MobileHCI community to discuss the current trends in portable technologies for sports and trace future directions for HCI research in this field.

TI Imagining the future of sport through art: an a/r/tographic inquiry
SO WORLD LEISURE JOURNAL
AB What will the future of sport look like, and what do the imaginings of today's youth tell us about society? In this paper, we asked youth to tell us - through their drawings and words - what sport will look like in 2040. Given the pervasive presence of sport in today's society, and the ability of sport to reaffirm and challenge societal values, these imaginings shed insight into the hopes and fears of youth today, and perhaps shed light on the future - in both sport and larger society. Based on an a/r/tographic approach where we read, analyzed, and interacted with these representations, we identified two overarching imaginings - rethinking gender norms and technology becoming part of the body. In the pages that follow, we lay out why imagining the future of sport can tell us so much, our a/r/tographic approach, and expand upon our two primary imaginings as we both interact with them and invite you, the reader, to imagine the future, critically examine these findings, and create the future you desire.

SO FRONTIERS IN CHEMISTRY
AB The processing technology of conjugated nanomaterials and the design of sports equipment are often regarded as two independent fields, resulting in poor performance in sports equipment design. Analyze the characteristics, preparation methods, and potential applications of conjugated nanomaterials, and use the unique properties of conjugated nanomaterials to improve the performance of sports equipment. Graphene conducts electricity very well and is the hardest among nanomaterials. Carbon Nanotubes (CNTs) exhibit good thermal conductivity. Therefore, this paper proposes to use CNT and graphene materials in Natural Rubber (NR) composites in sports equipment, and explores the relationship between the two. The experimental results showed that after 1,200 cycles, the CNT capacitances of M-120//GO, M-160//GO, and M-180//GO reached 43.3%, 87.3%, and 46.5% of the initial specific capacitance, respectively, indicating that the electrochemical storage performance of M-160//GO capacitor is good and the stability is high. The application in sports equipment can improve the battery capacity and enhance the practicability of the equipment.

AB Online education can use extensive search engines, digital libraries and social networking tools to find, access and share information, resources and materials. At the higher education administration level online education can streamline some administrative aspects of teaching as marking mass communication to students, uploading assessments (non-hardcopy model), automated marking, setting-up collaborate groups and facilitating final grade allocations. However with this evolution more creative and innovative teaching and assessment methods are required, especially considering the exercise and sport science is a discipline with a significant emphasis on the development of practical skills with motor elements as well as in its current form represents a technologically dependent discipline. The paper will describe how the program evolved from an internal model of delivery with minimal e-learning dependence to a predominantly an e-learning dependent external model as the clients moved to predominantly external students. The current ratio of internal to external is currently 1: 3 respectively. Outcomes of the trend to externalisation was the development of the first external exercise and sport science degree in Australia, development of significant learning infrastructure (both human and technology), redesign of laboratories and classrooms to capture real time lectures and practical as well as for storage in digital libraries, constant upgrading of LearnLine functionality (technology enhanced learning) and enhanced interactive functionality when staff-student and student-student communicate. A decisional balance model was also implemented to assess the positive and negative outcome when utilising of e-learning/technology enhanced learning.

In this paper, we study the electronic games deeply by the method of literature-analysis and comparative law. The study shows that: (1) Sports electronic entertainment product should have obvious sports attribute, so that users can enjoy the pleasure of sports fully. (2) Sports electronic entertainment products as one kinds of the leisure products, should be popular. Game should be set up in different levels which should be varied to suit different needs and different levels of users. (3) Network access model should be fully developed, supplying enjoyment to everyone. (4) The cost of Sports electronic entertainment product must be controlled strictly in the acceptable level of populace. Therefore, the idea of sports electronic entertainment product research should follow the principle of rich in leisure, emphasizing movement experience, easier to use and low cost, we should pay more attention to the feeling of user, rather than pursuit of improving technology blindly. We believe firmly that along with the improvement of electronic technology and the development of network technology, the digital sports leisure entertainment will bring brand-new experiences to us.

In the study that utilized qualitative research methods, interviews were done with the sports desk managers of five newspapers published in Turkey, the sports desk managers of two sport newspaper. The datas were collected through interviews done in depth. When the readers have been able to reach the developments more speedily through the internet sites of the newspapers and thematic TV channels, newspapers have displayed a tendency to find more varied news in their fields. However, the possibility to produce special news about Galatasaray, Fenerbahce and Besiktas with the highest number of fans in football; the most popular branch of sports, have decreased in the newspapers that regularly prepare news about them. Many clubs have closed their doors to journalists or put some limitations. Majority of the papers publish similar news. Journalism related to research or investigation has substantially decreased. The necessity for journalists has decreased in the newspapers. Internet has become one of the most important news resources for the newspapers. It has become sufficient to have an editor and a computer operator to prepare a page for publication. However, internet web sites have also created new employment opportunities. The sports pages of the newspapers have difficulty keeping up with the media that can produce news more speedily. Internet has created the concept of copying in journalism that has caused erosion in the quality of news content in the papers. Sports journalists are happy with the convenience internet has provided, however they also complain about the weakness of the news content.

TI Towards a "Digital" Sports Journalism: Field Theory, Changing Boundaries
   and Evolving Technologies
SO COMMUNICATION & SPORT
AB Long trivialized as the "toy department," sports journalism nevertheless represents an enduring, and vital subfield within journalism. As with many niches of journalism, sports journalism has needed to adjust to changes resulting from the technology of the field. In particular, digital sports journalism faces pressure from adjacent fields, represented in team and player media, which perform many of the same tasks historically attributed to sports journalism. Through the lens of field theory, the present study reports on long-form interviews with 47 sports journalists who self-defined their work as digital journalism. This study argues that the perception of insurgents-team media that prior research demonstrated is often seen as a part of the field-has caused digital sports journalists to view their work as economically vital to the individual newsroom, but not topically essential to the journalistic field at large.

TI "Are Fans in the Stands an Afterthought?": Sports Events, Decision-Aid
   Technologies, and the Television Match Official in Rugby Union
SO COMMUNICATION & SPORT
AB The intense commodification, commercialisation, mediatisation, globalisation, and digitalisation of sport in the past three decades have resulted in sporting organisations and governing bodies becoming inextricably tied to the global media industry and corporate economy. A result of this mediatisation, coupled with technological advancement, has been the introduction of decision-aid technologies in sport. Existing literature on decision-aid technologies has generally focused on the technologies themselves. Here, we focus on decision-aid technology use and its impact on event experience. This article examines fan attitudes towards the use of the Television Match Official (TMO) in rugby union in relation to the event experience. We present data from a global online questionnaire (n = 194) and 11 semi-structured interviews with fans, representatives from rugby's governing bodies, two TMOs, and a television producer. Data show an inconsistency in how TMO decisions are relayed to match crowds, which had an impact on events experience. The data also reveal how heavily reliant the TMO system is on broadcasters. Fans were generally in favour of TMO use, but they did want to be better informed when it came to TMO referrals and decisions. Indeed, fans said improvements to TMO decision delivery in stadia, specifically having audio of referee/TMO discussions/decisions relayed over the stadium PA system and/or captions providing explanations and decisions on TMO referrals, would mostly improve their event experience.

   Applications Among College Students
SO JOURNAL OF SPORT MANAGEMENT
AB The popularity of smartphones has led to the creation of sport-related mobile applications in the areas of games, fitness, information, and events for sport consumers. The main purpose of this study was to examine why college students use sport-related mobile applications and what benefits they received from their usage. The study employed the Motivation Scale for Sport Online Consumption and the Technology Acceptance Model to understand this usage in more detail. Using a mixed-method approach, the study revealed that college students identified fanship, convenience, and information as primary motives for using their sport-related mobile applications. For college students who are sport fans, supporting their fanship through these applications represents an important aspect of their lifestyle. Sport managers and sport application developers will benefit from understanding users' intentions and motives as the market for sport-related applications continues to grow.

TI Technology Innovation and Guardrails in Elite Sport: The Future is Now
SO SPORTS MEDICINE
AB A growing number of companies are developing or using wearable sensor technologies that can monitor, analyse and transmit data from humans in real time that can be used by the sporting, biomedical and media industries. To explore this phenomenon, we describe and review two high-profile sporting events where innovations in wearable technologies were trialled: the Tokyo 2020 Summer Olympic Games (Tokyo 2020, Japan) and the 2022 adidas Road to Records (Germany). These two major sporting events were the first time academic and industry partners came together to implement real-time wearable solutions during major competition, to protect the health of athletes competing in hot and humid environments, as well as to better understand how these metrics can be used moving forwards. Despite the undoubted benefits of such wearables, there are well-founded concerns regarding their use including: (1) limited evidence quantifying the potential beneficial effects of analysing specific parameters, (2) the quality of hardware and provided data, (3) information overload, (4) data security and (5) exaggerated marketing claims. Employment and sporting rules and regulations also need to evolve to facilitate the use of wearable devices. There is also the potential to obtain real-time data that will oblige medical personnel to make crucial decisions around whether their athletes should continue competing or withdraw for health reasons. To protect athletes, the urgent need is to overcome these ethical/data protection concerns and develop wearable technologies that are backed by quality science. The fields of sport and exercise science and medicine provide an excellent platform to understand the impact of wearable sensors on performance, wellness, health, and disease.

We aim to evidence how, by adopting the co-creation value concept, thanks to the new technologies, specifically the innovative communication channels, the Olympic Games assume a greater value and are more successful in terms of followers, as athletes, fans, participants, and so forth. Thanks to the spread of social networks in the Olympic Games, the general consumers, mainly the fans, are able to give feedbacks, opinions, suggestions, and evidence criticisms about the same mega sporting events, by interacting directly with athletes, organizers and all the actors involved in this very complex managerial and organizing process. This study, conducted through a review of the literature and a comparative analysis of Summer Olympic Games editions during the period 1992-2016, represents a research starting point that allows us to evidence the crucial role played by the social networks in the mega sporting events improving their social value in the co-creation value perspective. This paper may provide interesting theoretical and managerial implications.

Sports food provides nutrition to meet the metabolic and energy needs of sports people. The nutritional components of sports food can be divided into basic nutrients and functional factors. Basic nutrients refer to the nutrients or metabolites required by the human body. Functional factors are bioactive ingredients that have potential effects in improving functions of the human body, such as protection of articular cartilage and improving muscle quality. Currently, there are various forms of sports foods in the market, including sports drinks, solid sports foods, semi-solid sports foods, and sports nutrition supplements. The sports food industry has seen many opportunities such as the expanding market, manufacturing technology development, and increasing funds investment. However, it also faces many challenges, such as lack of innovation, insufficient in-depth research, risks, and safety issues. This review would provide guidance for current sports food manufacture to meet the needs of increasing sports people worldwide.

AB The new pandemic lifestyle advocates new rules for sport at all levels, from amateur to elite. Consequently, it has transformed the ways in which sports are performed and consumed, provoking demand for new technologies and/or the development of existing ones. This paper aims to identify, describe, and visualize the process of sport transformation as radical internal and external industry changes brought about by the COVID-19 pandemic. It is intended to qualitatively explain the current 'metamorphoses' in the field and subsequently answer the question of how the COVID-19 pandemic drastically changed all aspects of sports and physical culture. The literature and empirical dataset (qualitative open-ended written interviews, N = 147) were analysed in the spirit of grounded theory, referring to the holistic approach. The results demonstrated that the COVID-19 pandemic has had an unprecedented effect on sports by touching on all aspects, levels, and stakeholders. The paper also outlines challenges and opportunities for the industry in these extraordinary times. The key dimensions of transformation are identified and explained. The findings of this research have significant implications for the understanding of how COVID-19 gave rise to the transformation of sports in different aspects. This study adds to the growing body of research on the positive and negative impacts of COVID-19 on sports, new technologies demand, and the transformation of sports.

CY 2016
CL San Diego, CA
AB Sport- related injuries impose a substantial economic burden, and they often have persisting adverse effects on health-related quality of life. Abundant research evidence points to a history of previous injury as the strongest predictor of injury occurrence over the course of a sport season. Although a predisposition may have existed prior to the first injury occurrence, incomplete restoration of all pre-injury functional capabilities is undoubtedly a major factor that elevates risk for a subsequent injury. Hence, detection and prevention of sports injuries becomes an important aspect of player's well-being and performance. Injury prevention has been identified as an area that has great potential for advancement through the application of big data analytics, but relatively little progress has been made to date. The prevailing sport injury management paradigm appears to lack sufficient emphasis on some important linkages of neuromuscular function and neurological processes. Our extensive review of sports medicine literature also suggests great potential for improvement of both sport-related injury management and injury prevent procedures. Unfortunately, very little high-quality research evidence is available to guide the selection of screening tests or the interpretation of their results. This study makes the first attempt in the IS field on systematically addressing this gap by synthesizing sports medicine literature to present a conceptual and theoretical underpinnings for developing a) a mobile based technology that integrates disparate data sources such as internet of things, medical records and cognitive data, b) automated data collection and analysis of on-the-fly screening processes for assessing neuromuscular or neurological injuries.

AB Deciphering the human genome, and further development of omics technologies, have opened new opportunities in studying the molecular mechanisms underlying the sport success. According to modern concepts of functional genomics, it is believed that individual differences in the degree of development of physical and mental qualities, as well as in the susceptibility to different diseases of athletes are largely due to DNA polymorphisms. Genetic markers associated with the development and manifestation of physical qualities (speed, strength, endurance, agility, flexibility) can be used in the sports selection system, to clarify sports specialization and to optimize the training process. Other molecular markers (methyl groups, transcripts, telomerase activity, telomeres, circulating DNA, metabolites, proteins, etc.) in addition to predicting athletic performance, allow assessing the current functional state of the athlete, including the phenomenon of overtraining. The purpose of this review is to provide data on the use of genomic, epigenetic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolic methods in sports talent identification, assessing the current functional status of athletes and in the prescription of personal training and nutrition programs. Future research, including multicentre genome-wide association studies and wholegenome sequencing in large cohorts of athletes with further validation and replication, will substantially contribute to the discovery of large numbers of the causal genetic variants (mutations and DNA polymorphisms) that would partly explain the heritability of athlete status and related phenotypes.

The aim of this paper is to systematically review the latest developments of motion capture systems for the analysis of sport performance. To that end, selected keywords were searched on studies published in the last four years in the electronic databases ISI Web of Knowledge, Scopus, PubMed and SPORTDiscus, which resulted in 892 potential records. After duplicate removal and screening of the remaining records, 81 journal papers were retained for inclusion in this review, distributed as 53 records for optical systems, 15 records for non-optical systems and 13 records for markerless systems. Resultant records were screened to distribute them according to the following analysis categories: biomechanical motion analysis, validation of new systems and performance enhancement. Although optical systems are regarded as golden standard with accurate results, the cost of equipment and time needed to capture and postprocess data have led researchers to test other technologies. First, non-optical systems rely on attaching sensors to body parts to send their spatial information to computer wirelessly by means of different technologies, such as electromagnetic and inertial (accelerometry). Finally, markerless systems are adequate for free, unobstructive motion analysis since no attachment is carried by athletes. However, more sensors and sophisticated signal processing must be used to increase the expected level of accuracy.

TI Converting sports diplomacy to diplomatic outcomes: Introducing a sports
   diplomacy model
SO INTERNATIONAL AREA STUDIES REVIEW
AB As sport has become an integral part of society, it has also become a tool for diplomacy around the world. The purpose of this study is to introduce a sports diplomacy model and identify "the critical abilities" for converting sport soft power tools into resources for diplomatic outcomes. The data for this research comprise 30 online surveys completed by international experts in the fields of sports and public diplomacy. The responses were qualitatively analyzed using the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM). After running two rounds of fuzzy Delphi, two main strategies for sports diplomacy emerged-maintaining "official and sports diplomacy solidarity" and using sport figures as "competent cultural ambassadors." The proposed model includes the most applicable sports diplomacy resources, the most expected diplomatic outcomes, and the major conversion tools (skillful strategies) in the viewpoint of sports and public diplomacy experts. The application of the model finds that states can expect diplomatic outcomes if appropriate sports diplomacy resources and conversion strategies are implemented in an orderly, innovative and accurate manner.

SO SPORT MARKETING QUARTERLY
AB Drawing upon the technology acceptance model, the aim of this study was to describe the effects of technology innovations in Formula 1 (F1) on fans' satisfaction and commitment to consumption of F1 as a TV product, controlling for identification with F1 and specific teams and drivers. We surveyed F1 fans (N = 449) contacted via web-based forums. Results of a structural equation modeling showed that positive perceptions of technology innovation lead to satisfaction with F1 as a TV product, which in turn leads to commitment to consumption. Highly identified fans are committed to consuming the sport on TV, but they do not necessarily accept F1 new technologies. Technology changes that increase predictability and competitive unbalance are not well received and may lead to less consumption of F1 on TV. F1 managers need to make careful analysis before introducing new technology, which might decrease the TV audience for F1 races.

TI Awareness and Perceived Value of Eye Tracking Technology for Concussion
   Assessment among Sports Medicine Clinicians: A Multinational Study
SO PHYSICIAN AND SPORTSMEDICINE
AB Objective: The awareness of concussion as a serious and frequently occurring sports injury and its management has evolved significantly. One viable objective diagnostic tool is eye tracking technology. The authors hypothesized that while clinicians may be aware that assessing eye movements in concussed athletes can be beneficial, it is possible that, due to the novelty of the eye tracking technology and limited exposure, only a few actually use it in their practice. The study aimed to assess the awareness of eye movement deficits associated with concussion amongst sports medicine clinicians and to determine the utilization and perceptions of the eye tracking technology for concussion diagnosis. Methods: An online 18-question survey was distributed internationally from January until December 2017 and completed by 171 sports medicine clinicians (sport physicians, therapists, general practitioners, neuropsychologists) from 32 countries. Results: Respondents indicated that subjectivity of assessments remained a major limitation of established diagnostic tools. Eye tracking technology, despite its potential to attenuate this limitation, was only used by 12% of respondents. To diagnose concussion, 77% did not use any eye movement assessment tools other than own clinical assessment. With the exception of abnormal pupil light reflex, which was checked by 68%, eye movement deficits were inspected by less than half of the respondents (46.3 +/- 12%). Conclusion: Even among sports medicine clinicians who regularly attend to patients with concussions, there is insufficient awareness that concussion can lead to abnormal eye tracking behavior. Lack of exposure to the sensitive eye tracking equipment may be a limiting factor for using eye movement metrics for concussion diagnostics. Facilitating the awareness of objective methods, like eye tracking technology, may help assure the appropriate continuum of identification and treatment for concussed athletes. Increasing educational opportunities and practical experience of clinicians regarding concussive symptoms and potential innovative technology is strongly advocated.

Today, the challenge of the New Technologies, the globalization of the sport and his great linguistic creativity that they form the need to control and to protect the language. The objective of this research is to know which are the principal linguistic mistakes of the sports information in the digital press. These deviations of the rules commit an outrage against the idiomatic correctness of the Spanish Language. On the one hand, the research reveales that the sports press includes terms of violent language, metaphors, gallicisms, anglicisms, omission of the article and incorrect use of the prepositions. On the other hand, in the sports language states the terminology of different areas as the religion, the health, the epic or the music. The reasons of these lexical mistakes are diverse: unconcern for the good use of the language and limitation of space in the news. All this, it concerns the area of the Humanities and, consequently, to the society.

TI Methodological Considerations for Furthering the Understanding of
   Constraints in Applied Sports
SO SPORTS MEDICINE-OPEN
AB Commonly classified as individual, task or environmental, constraints are boundaries which shape the emergence of functional movement solutions. In applied sport, an ongoing challenge is to improve the measurement, analysis and understanding of constraints to key stakeholders. Methodological considerations for furthering these pursuits should be centred around an interdisciplinary approach. This integration of methodology and knowledge from different disciplines also encourages the sharing of encompassing principles, concepts, methods and data to generate new solutions to existing problems. This narrative review discusses how a number of rapidly developing fields are positioned to help guide, support and progress an understanding of sport through constraints. It specifically focuses on examples from the fields of technology, analytics and perceptual science. It discusses how technology is generating large quantities of data which can improve our understanding of how constraints shape the movement solutions of performers in training and competition environments. Analytics can facilitate new insights from numerous and complex data through enhanced non-linear and multivariate analysis techniques. The role of the perceptual sciences is discussed with respect to generating outputs from analytics that are more interpretable for the end-user. Together, these three fields of technology, analytics and perceptual science may enable a more comprehensive understanding of constraints in sports performance.

TI Toward a new (evolutionary) economics of sports
SO SPORT BUSINESS AND MANAGEMENT-AN INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL
AB Purpose - The purpose of this paper is to propose a new classification of rules-driven sports and technology-driven sports that suggests different models of how sports develop. This paper outlines some key aspects of an evolutionary view of sports economics research and, separately, an institutional view of sports economic research.
   Design/methodology/approach - This paper is a conceptual/theoretical piece rather than an empirical analysis of a research question. The authors scaffold a proposed analytic framework that is a combination of evolutionary economics and new institutional economics.
   Findings - A new dynamic approach to the study of sports industries is called for. The authors observe that sports and sports industries exhibit dynamic qualities but in the study of sports there is no analogue of "industrial dynamics" as in economics. What is missing is the field of "evolutionary sports dynamics." To build this, the authors frame a new evolutionary approach to the study of the sports economy and sports industries - by examining the evolution of sports, their industries, and the complex industrial ecosystems they operate in, through the lens of institutional and evolutionary economics.
   Originality/value - The paper establishes a theoretical basis for a "New Economics of Sports" - as a shift in the types of questions that sports economics seeks to answer. These are away from "sports statics" - as a branch of applied economics of industrial organization and optimal allocation of sports resources (ala Rottenberg, 1956; Neale, 1964) - and toward concern with the economics of "sports dynamics." The prime questions are less with the optimal organization of existing sports, and more toward understanding the origin of new sports and the evolutionary life cycles of sports.

TI Daily fantasy sports and the law in the USA
SO INTERNATIONAL SPORTS LAW JOURNAL
AB This chapter examines legal, regulatory, and social issues surrounding the phenomenon of the daily fantasy sports (DFS) industry in the USA. Traditional fantasy sports contests largely involved groups of family or friends creating their own respective "fantasy" teams of real professional athletes, whose actual games results over the course of an entire season determined the success of one's fantasy team. Fantasy sports contests were not considered gambling on sports, and federal legislation exempts "fantasy sports" from prohibitions against online gambling. As the name implied, DFS is a different product, offering users who pay the DFS operating company to select their team roster on a daily basis, competitions can occur over a day or a week depending on the contest, and among thousands of users, few of whom are consistent winners in the contests. The DFS commercials and advertisements are again blaring the airwaves. Major DFS operators are expanding their product lines and are now fully immersed in online, mobile, and casino sports gambling in states where legal. The DFS and sports gaming market is booming; the technology, analytics, user sophistication, financial stakes, and the distinction between DFS and gambling are increasingly blurred. This chapter considers the legal, regulatory, and social issues arising from the expanding DFS and sport gaming business.

Findings It was observed that through entrepreneurship, innovation plays a crucial role in contributing to the sports industry through research, and technology adaptation. The wide variation in the adaptation techniques of innovation in the entrepreneurship realm for sports can be supported by three aspects: a strong culture of innovation, the adaptation of technology from other sectors for sports entrepreneurship and network support. Originality/value There is little emphasis on sports in mainstream entrepreneurship or innovation research. Therefore, this research is one of the few in this area to look at the interconnectivity between entrepreneurship, innovation and sports.

The regress formulas among the basic parts and other dominant parts of body were setuped for designing fit sport girdles. In order to further research dynamic fit of sport girdles, six healthy females aged between 23 and 27 years old (mean age 25 years) were recruited from 400 female for a wear trial. The subjects entered a climate chamber where the temperature was controlled at 27 +/- 2 c and the relative humidity at 60 +/- 10%. Skin pressure was exerted by two kinds of sport girdles on the lower bodies. The values of skin pressure of five different skin areas were different during three different exercises. Through analyzing these data, we found the values of skin pressure depend on the wearer size and shape. So the size fit of a sport girdle and the freedom of movement it allows, are the key to achieve optimal sport girdle solutions.

AB In recent years, our country has hosted many large sports activities such as the Olympic Games in Beijing and Guangzhou national games. Large sports activities not only show sports technical level, but increase the enthusiasm of Chinese residents in participating in physical exercise. The larger number of our country's residents to participate in physical exercise, the more people who are concern about China's sports cause development. This study adopts tracking survey, questionnaire and mathematical statistics and other research methods, two sampling surveys are conducted in the next five years in Sichuan province on urban residents aged over 18, and multivariate linear regression model is applied to analyze the data collected. Research shows that the successful holding of sports events like The First Session of National Intelligence Games, the National Archery Championships, and Modern Pentathlon World Championships in Sichuan have a great influence on sports awareness and sports behavior of urban residents. Gender of residents has significant difference to the enthusiasm of physical exercise, but the participation of sports is more than those five years ago. Large sports events evidently affect the enthusiasm of residents' physical exercise. The more residents participate in sports activities, the more attention is paid to the development of sports undertakings in China. Most respondents have favorite sports, and their sports values are more scientific.

TI EXPLORING THE IMPACT OF DIGITAL COMPETENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ACCEPTANCE ON
   ACADEMIC PERFORMANCE IN PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND SPORTS SCIENCE STUDENTS
SO JOURNAL OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY EDUCATION-RESEARCH
AB Aim/Purpose This study aims to examine the influence of digital competences, technology acceptance, and individual factors (gender and educational level) on academic achievement in Physical Education and Sports Science (PESS). Background Prior research has established a positive correlation between digital competences and performance, but the mediating role of technology acceptance remains unclear. Furthermore, there is no evidence in the literature about this relationship among students pursuing degrees in PESS. dents' Digital Competence Scale (SDiCoS) measured digital competences, while the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) assessed technology acceptance. Academic performance was evaluated based on students' GPAs. Contribution This paper investigated the role of digital competence within the TAM framework and its influence on academic performance. We propose that digital competence variables positively impact students' intention to use digital tools for learning. This aligns with TAM principles, where intention and attitude toward technology predict its actual use. Our findings further strengthen the understanding of TAM by confirming strong connections between perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, and attitude toward technology. Additionally, the study suggests that digital competence and frequent device usage patterns might be more prevalent in postgraduate education. Findings The investigation supports the link between digital competences and technology acceptance in PESS students. Specifically, TAM variables, particularly attitudes and intentions regarding technology use, significantly predicted these students' academic performance. Interestingly, no direct association was found between SDiCoS digital competences and academic performance. Digital competence variables were positively associated with students' intention to use digital tools for learning. Gender differences emerged, with females reporting higher academic performance and proficiency in Communicate, Collaborate, and Share (CCS) competences. Furthermore, postgraduate students reported digital competences, higher academic performance, stronger intentions to use technology, and more frequent utilization of laptops/tablets. Recommendations for Practitioners Recommendations for Researchers Educators, administrators, and policymakers should consider targeted interventions and curriculum development to enhance academic performance in the fields of physical education and sports science. Specifically, strategies should focus on fostering digital competences in areas relevant to the field while addressing gender-specific needs. Future research should further explore the nuanced relationship between digital competences, technology acceptance, and academic performance, with a focus on refining the predictive efficacy of TAM variables and examining the role of individual factors, such as motivation and self-efficacy. Impact on Society The findings have implications for improving academic outcomes in PESS, ultimately contributing to the development of a highly skilled and technology-literate workforce in this field. Future Research Future research should examine the specific mechanisms through which digital competences and technology acceptance influence academic performance to develop effective interventions and strategies.

AB The tenacity, regarding perseverance and persistence, is a very important psycho-motric quality for all sports, but mostly for combat sports. Being a quality from the volitive sphere, the measure can only be proven post factum. The indirect, correlative testing offers true information, using a tenacity index based on the solicitation of the excito-inhibitory processes of the palm flexor effort (amplitude, period, consistence, visual control of the oscillation etc.). Our research points out the fact that the tenacity index in significantly higher (300.14) for the right-handed athletes than for the left-handed ones or ambidextrous ones (259.62), at the significance threshold F<F critic (1,16<1,76).

TI APPLICATION OF 3D ANALYSIS TECHNOLOGY OF VISION SYSTEM IMAGE IN SPORTS
   MEDICINE
SO REVISTA BRASILEIRA DE MEDICINA DO ESPORTE
AB Background: Objective: The study of sports biomechanics in sports medicine usually requires a special image analysis system (software) to obtain 3D kinematics data. Taking the swimming project in sports medicine as an example, 3D water images in water have always been relatively complicated and difficult. As light travels in different media, it will refract and reflect. When testing underwater movements, if only a land camera or an underwater camera is used for testing, the error caused by light refraction will be larger, which will affect the accuracy of the test data even more. Methods: Taking breaststroke movement as an example, a three-dimensional measurement method based on the Kwon3D movement analysis system is introduced. This method is different from the simple underwater camera test. It is a three- dimensional test method combining a land camera and an underwater camera. Two underwater cameras and two land cameras were used to simultaneously calibrate the water and underwater space with the same calibration frame in the experiment after analyzing and verifying the accuracy of 3D reconstruction. Results: The comprehensive reconstruction error is small, and the average relative error is less than 1%. Conclusions: The application of three-dimensional image analysis technology of vision systems in sports medicine is reasonable and worth promoting. Level of evidence II; Therapeutic studies - investigation of treatment results.

AB Mobile devices and specific applications for sport professionals have become nowadays very useful in specific training, but their potential is not fully exploited. The general goal of this paper is to point out bridges between the two communities of sport professionals and mobile applications developers. In this paper we survey these mobile devices according to these two different viewpoints. We first take into account their utility, the sports involved, and the specific training processes and present the available offer of mobile devices and applications. Main producers and tools are mentioned as well. The sport professional's viewpoint shows the way they perceive the mobile applications and devices in the training process, and what are their expectations. Then we consider the technological aspects of the mobile devices and their potential for sport professionals. The technological aspects are treated from the developer's point of view. We present what the nowadays mobile devices are able to offer for the benefit of the sport, due to their design and embedded technology, tools and capabilities. Different operating systems, main producers of mobile devices and developers of mobile applications are briefly mentioned. A short classification of the applications for mobile devices is given, and the levels of the corresponding software developing skills are also mentioned. This suggests an ideal composition of a mobile application developing team. Our paper is an invitation for reflexion on the modern approaches of professional sport training through the nowadays mobile technologies. The invitation is addressed both to sport professionals and mobile devices developers. We conclude that the mobile devices and applications have a huge potential for sport professionals and, at the same time, the sport training offers a large domain of applications to the mobile devices developers.

TI Exploring the use of technology among newly arrived children in Hong
   Kong: from an e-sports and cultural capital perspective
SO ETR&D-EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
AB Based on Bourdieu's cultural capital theory, our study examined the engagement of newly arrived children (NAC) with ICT and e-sports both at home and in school in the context of Hong Kong. Our in-depth case study of a Hong Kong secondary school revealed that the selected NAC typically came from disadvantaged school and immigrant family backgrounds. They had limited access to technology and little parental mediation at home. The results also showed that as these NAC excessively used ICT at home for multiplayer online games, they became active e-sports players with good ICT skills. These students created an e-sports culture in the school, which was supported by their teachers and the principal. Contrary to their parents' conservative and negative attitude towards a career in e-sports or the ICT industry, the principal and teachers viewed e-sports as an alternative way for their students to accumulate capital and provide them with opportunities for upward social mobility. The findings demonstrate the importance of education in bridging the digital divide of NAC and helping them accumulate the digital dimension of cultural capital.

We find clear support for the overshooting hypothesis in this case, with adverse consequences not only for the sport's manufacturing, distribution and retail sectors but we also find indications of spillover effects in allied sectors. We suggest that industry self-regulation may be a way of avoiding this phenomenon and its adverse consequences. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

TI The application of 360°VR for training sports officials: a
   constraints-led approach
SO MANAGING SPORT AND LEISURE
AB Rationale: New technologies are an important tool for facilitating development of sports officials, particularly in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. 360 degrees VR presents an innovative opportunity for amateur officiating organisations to develop more game-like (i.e. representative) training opportunities outside of competition.
   Design: This commentary paper outlines 360 degrees VR from a constraints-led approach.
   Findings: This article provides a practical guide of how to design, develop, and deliver this innovative technology for officials. 360 degrees VR affords the opportunity to deliver more individualised training for officials, incorporating key environmental constraints such as crowd noise, and reproducing head movements that closely simulate scanning in a game. The rationale for 360 degrees VR as a more representative training tool is discussed, with future avenues for applying this technology described, which include psychological training, reflective practice, and developing decision-making skills.
   Practical implications: 360 degrees VR is a tool that can be used in a range of areas for developing sports officiating. While there are some limitations of this technology, there are many opportunities to engage with amateur officials using this technology which is considered more enjoyable and relevant.
   Research contribution: This commentary paper provides a theoretical rationale for using 360 degrees VR in sports officials from a constraints-led perspective, and is the first paper to do so in sports officiating.

TI USE OF INTEGRATED TECHNOLOGY IN TEAM SPORTS: A REVIEW OF OPPORTUNITIES,
   CHALLENGES, AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS FOR ATHLETES
SO JOURNAL OF STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING RESEARCH
AB Dellaserra, CL, Gao, Y, and Ransdell, L. Use of integrated technology in team sports: A review of opportunities, challenges, and future directions for athletes. J Strength Cond Res 28(2): 556-573, 2014Integrated technology (IT), which includes accelerometers, global positioning systems (GPSs), and heart rate monitors, has been used frequently in public health. More recently, IT data have been used in sports settings to assess training and performance demands. However, the impact of IT in sports settings is yet to be evaluated, particularly in field-based team sports. This narrative-qualitative review provides an overview of the emerging impact of IT in sports settings. Twenty electronic databases (e.g., Medline, SPORTdiscus, and ScienceDirect), print publications (e.g., Signal Processing Magazine and Catapult Innovations news releases), and internet resources were searched using different combinations of keywords as follows: accelerometers, heart rate monitors, GPS, sport training, and field-based sports for relevant articles published from 1990 to the present. A total of 114 publications were identified, and 39 that examined a field-based team sport using a form of IT were analyzed. The articles chosen for analysis examined a field-based team sport using a form of IT. The uses of IT can be divided into 4 categories: (a) quantifying movement patterns (n = 22), (b) assessing the differences between demands of training and competition (n = 12), (c) measuring physiological and metabolic responses (n = 16), and (d) determining a valid definition for velocity and a sprint effort (n = 8). Most studies used elite adult male athletes as participants and analyzed the sports of Australian Rules football, field hockey, cricket, and soccer, with sample sizes between 5 and 20 participants. The limitations of IT in a sports setting include scalability issues, cost, and the inability to receive signals within indoor environments. Integrated technology can contribute to significant improvements in the preparation, training, and recovery aspects of field-based team sports. Future research should focus on using IT with female athlete populations and developing resources to use IT indoors to further enhance individual and team performances.

TI Fabrication of sports mouthguards using a semi-digital workflow with
   4D-printing technology
SO JOURNAL OF PROSTHODONTIC RESEARCH
AB Purpose: This technical procedure report explains the fabrication protocol for a newly developed 4D-printed sports mouthguard (MG) based on 4D-printing technology.Methods: An intraoral scanner was used to scan a maxillary arch model. A two-layer sports MG was designed based on the scanned model using computer-aided design software and output in a standard tessellation language file format. Two types of filament materials were used for the MG material: a thermoplastic shape memory polyurethane elastomer with a unique glass transition temperature for the external layer and a thermoplastic elastomer for the internal layer. Both MGs were printed using a fused deposition modeling 3D printer and assembled using adhesives after trimming the support material. To confirm the shape-memory performance of the fabricated 4D-printed MG, a deviation analysis was performed by superimposing the internal surface data of the fabricated MG and the MG whose shape was recovered. The distance be-tween the data obtained by deviation analysis was calculated, and the root mean square error value (mm) was determined.Conclusions: The 4D-printing technology simplifies the complex processes required with conventional methods. It also overcomes the issues of conventional and 3D-printed MGs, such as the reduced fitting accuracy caused by deformation, because this technology employs shape memory materials.

AB The current era is an information age, and society is turning to the information age. The image processing technology is also widely used in various fields, and the technology of sports action recognition based on image processing technology can also be said to be appropriate. This article uses a spatial visual feature analysis algorithm to implement it. To implement this algorithm, a series of work such as image collection, feature extraction, and action recognition must be completed first and then implemented through texture functions and other related functions. This algorithm can be used to complete the image-based sports action recognition technology at the minimum time cost. This algorithm can help sportsmen better complete training and standardize movements to a certain extent. As for the development of China's current sports industry structure, it is also steadily improving. The people's love for sports is getting stronger and stronger, which also makes the development of China's sports industry still benefit a lot.

TI When the Medium Becomes "Well Done": Sport, Television, and Technology
   in the Twenty-First Century
SO TELEVISION & NEW MEDIA
AB One of the fundamental issues in the relation between television and sports has been the transference from watching a game or a sport in the field (the stadium) to the viewing experience through a proxy (the medium). The present article argues that sport broadcasts on television in the twenty-first century do not merely provide a sophisticated view of what takes place at the stadium but a new creation with unique characteristics. By using the latest technology-driven examples and assuming that other ones are already being used such as the second screen combination of watching TV and simultaneously using a smartphone or tablet for better statistics or social interaction, it is asserted that being there has become less imperative, as alternatives to watching matches live and in person at many sporting events have become in many cases better options.

TI New technologies applied to ultrasound diagnosis of sports injuries
SO ADVANCES IN THERAPY
AB The aim of this study was to compare the ultrasound images of different soft tissue lesions from two different portable sonography devices: a conventional portable sonography device (ultrasound [US]-A, Micromaxx model; Sonosite Inc., Bothell, WA, USA), and a recently marketed compact device (US-B, Logiq e; General Electric Healthcare, Wauwatosa, WI, USA). The US-B device uses the new technologies of tissue harmonic imaging, real-time compound ultrasound, panoramic view, three-dimensional imaging, and virtual convex imaging.
   We compared ultrasound images of six different types of soft tissue lesions (muscle contusion, muscle strain, patellar tendinosis, calcifying patellar tendinosis, rupture of the lateral internal ligament of the knee, and deep infrapatellar synovial bursa), from six different subjects. Analysis of images was performed by the same ultrasound specialist. In accordance with the classical criteria for ultrasound studies, the following quantitative indicators and parameters of ultrasound quality were used to evaluate the images: degree of echogenicity, size of the lesion area, aspect, shape, borders, and overall visualization.
   In muscle lesions due to contusion, not only is the edematous area better visualized with the new system, but definition of hemorrhagic area borders and their content is especially increased. In lesions of the tendons, the new system affords better definition of the borders of the hypoechogenic area of tendinous degeneration and perfect visualization of the extension of the damaged area using a panoramic study. Sonographic study of ligaments with chronic lesions permits visualization of scar areas. Finally, use of the new system with a small synovial bursa shows the content of the bursa and thickness of the walls more clearly.
   Overall, the quantitative indicators and parameters of image quality performed in this study of common sports lesions demonstrate the improvement in visualization of damaged soft tissues with the new technologies now incorporated into portable sonography devices.

TI Spatialising Sport Management
SO JOURNAL OF GEOGRAPHY IN HIGHER EDUCATION
AB Sport and geography may be considered allied and complementary disciplines. They share, variously, interests in ideological and physical spaces, political and socio-cultural processes of space- and place-making, historical dis-/continuities, individual and collective identity formation, demography and topographies and representational practices therein. Sports geography modules may, for example, be taught independently within Geography, Sport Management/Studies/Science, Urban Studies, Development or Liberal Arts programmes, or form a bridge across shared degree/honours courses as a way of attracting an interdisciplinary audience of students. Regardless of institutional "home", sports geography, affords a rich context for engaging students with critical contemporary issues, global-local analysis, and socio-cultural complexities and social justice concerns. We argue in this paper for a more pronounced place for sports geography - specifically, critical spatial studies - within Sports Management. We draw on our professional and personal experiences teaching sport and geography related courses. We contextualise the teaching of sports geography against wider Higher Education forces. Next we provide pedagogical illustrations of the benefits of a sports geography focus. We offer some recommendations and reflections. Ultimately, we advocate for improved collaboration between Sports Management and Geography fields, and call for continued scholarly and pedagogical symbiosis and play that might produce new and creative interdisciplinary inquiry.

AB This work is part of an ongoing Sports, Technology, and Learning class where computer science students and student-athletes learn different aspects of technological development, ideation, design, and prototyping in the context of sports technologies.
   Alongside developing these technical skills, this class also takes advantage of various media related to sports to examine and discuss utilizing such media as a contextualizing factor in deciding what to build and why. Media depictions of sports and the role of technology in the creation of narratives and innovation is an often under-examined way of furthering understandings about the social construction of numerous phenomena like race, gender, and ability. In this poster, we present and discuss a pilot assignment using Critical Media Literacy (CML) tenets as an explicit tool for engaging with media discussions in class and how it can impact learners' understandings and practices around technology ideation, design, and critique.
   As the students engage with the media collected for the course, such as films & television, conference & journal articles, and sports journalism, they engage people outside of the class with course content and document the engagements in an assortment of formats (e.g., writing, podcasting, videos, drawings, etc.). The discussions continue throughout the quarter, aiming to develop the student's awareness of a context at the intersection of sports and technology that will inform their final design projects.

SO HELIYON
AB Despite China's heavy investment in sports infrastructure development in the last decades, the financial resources utilization efficiency (FRUE), regional technological gap (TGR), and total factor productivity change (TFPC) in sports infrastructure development are undiscovered and worth investigating. To this end, this study employed DEA-SBM, Meta-frontier analysis, and Malmquist productivity index on the data set of 31 Chinese provinces and 3 regions for the years 2014-2021 to gauge the FRUE, TGR, and TFPC in sports infrastructure development. The results indicate that the average FRUE is 0.4859, with a growth potential of 51.41% in financial resource utilization efficiency for sports infrastructure development. Further Eastern region is more efficient as compared to the Central and western regions. Beijing, Shanghai, Tibet, Hainan, and Guangdong are top performers in FRUE. Further, the value of TGR in the East is 0.9787 which is higher than in Central (0.4977), and Western (0.5821) regions. It indicates that the eastern region contains superior production technology in the development of the sports infrastructure in China. Moreover, the average TFPC value is 1.035 witnessed a 3.5% growth, primarily determined by technological change (TC). As TC = 1.0273 is higher than efficiency change EC = 0.997. The eastern region has a higher average TFPC of 1.048, indicating higher total factor productivity growth in sports infrastructure development. Beijing, Liaoning, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Zhejiang are the top performers in the TFP growth over the study period. Finally, the Kruskal-Wallis test proved the statistically significant difference in three regions of China for FRUE, TGR, and TFPC in sports infrastructure development.

AB This study analyzes patents and patent applications for wearable, non-invasive continuous glucose monitors (CGMs), distinguishing between those specifically claiming sports applications and those potentially applicable to sports. Although largely untested, the capacity of CGMs to capture the duration, magnitude, and frequency of interstitial glucose fluctuations may present a unique opportunity to monitor fueling adequacy around competitive events and training sessions, with applications for applied research and sports nutrition practice. We used Espacenet and FamPat databases to conduct both text-based and classification-based queries to enhance the precision and scope of our findings. The patents were categorized into three main technological groups: optical, electrochemical, and electromagnetic. For each category, we analyzed their suitability and limitations in practical applications. We also conducted a forward citation analysis to assess the impact and interest generated by these technological families and applications. Our insights highlight the drive towards continuous, wearable, and sport-oriented glucose monitors, with optical glucose monitoring technologies being the most frequently patented by major wearable companies due to their ease of integration into devices like smartwatches and rings. Patents of CGMs based on biofluids showed the greater technological impact among the documents evaluated in this study, and they could represent a promising frontier in the market of non-invasive glucose monitoring.

In order to exemplify this last point, I shall look at the ways in which fantasy sport, a relatively recent phenomenon that is predominantly tied to and operated through various forms of digital media, is transforming what Jonathan Crary (1998) would call the 'visual regime' of the field of sport. I shall start with two sets of (brief) contextualising introductions: the first will provide a very general history of the development of the sport-mass media nexus; the second look at the relatively recent phenomenon of fantasy sport, and then describe and analyse how digitally mediated fantasy sport produces an entirely different way of looking at the things of sport and by extension transforms the traditional visual regime of sports' spectatorship.

SO COMMUNICATION & SPORT
AB In this essay, Walter Gantz reflects on the importance of communication and sport and the evolution of his research on fanship and social relationships. Cutting across two overlapping dimensions-physical location and technology-this essay characterizes key ways that sports fanship may be integrally linked with meaningful relationships. Sports viewing at home is often a shared activity, one that is far more likely to maintain or enhance existing relationships than isolate or annoy family members and create significant strife. Sports viewing during holidays can create special frustrations but these, too, seem easily addressed by family members. Out-of-home attention to mediated sports-from sports bars to the workplace-also has a strong social dimension as participants are able to share and affirm their fanship, at times at a cost to productivity. Social media and other interactive technologies (e.g., talk radio, smart phones, the Internet) facilitate sports-related expression and community. Research still needs to be conducted on the social dimension of sports fanship across the span of adult life.

TI Role of biomarkers and emerging technologies in defining and assessing
   neurobiological recovery after sport-related concussion: a systematic
   review
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE
AB ObjectiveDetermine the role of fluid-based biomarkers, advanced neuroimaging, genetic testing and emerging technologies in defining and assessing neurobiological recovery after sport-related concussion (SRC). DesignSystematic review. Data sourcesSearches of seven databases from 1 January 2001 through 24 March 2022 using keywords and index terms relevant to concussion, sports and neurobiological recovery. Separate reviews were conducted for studies involving neuroimaging, fluid biomarkers, genetic testing and emerging technologies. A standardised method and data extraction tool was used to document the study design, population, methodology and results. Reviewers also rated the risk of bias and quality of each study. Eligibility criteria for selecting studiesStudies were included if they: (1) were published in English; (2) represented original research; (3) involved human research; (4) pertained only to SRC; (5) included data involving neuroimaging (including electrophysiological testing), fluid biomarkers or genetic testing or other advanced technologies used to assess neurobiological recovery after SRC; (6) had a minimum of one data collection point within 6 months post-SRC; and (7) contained a minimum sample size of 10 participants. ResultsA total of 205 studies met inclusion criteria, including 81 neuroimaging, 50 fluid biomarkers, 5 genetic testing, 73 advanced technologies studies (4 studies overlapped two separate domains). Numerous studies have demonstrated the ability of neuroimaging and fluid-based biomarkers to detect the acute effects of concussion and to track neurobiological recovery after injury. Recent studies have also reported on the diagnostic and prognostic performance of emerging technologies in the assessment of SRC. In sum, the available evidence reinforces the theory that physiological recovery may persist beyond clinical recovery after SRC. The potential role of genetic testing remains unclear based on limited research. ConclusionsAdvanced neuroimaging, fluid-based biomarkers, genetic testing and emerging technologies are valuable research tools for the study of SRC, but there is not sufficient evidence to recommend their use in clinical practice.

TI Overcoming the organization-practice barrier in sports injury
   prevention: A nonhierarchical organizational model
SO SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE & SCIENCE IN SPORTS
AB The organization of sports at the national level has seldom been included in scientific discussions of sports injury prevention. The aim of this study was to develop a model for organization of sports that supports prevention of overuse injuries. The quality function deployment technique was applied in seminars over a two-season period to develop a national organizational structure for athletics in Sweden that facilitates prevention of overuse injuries. Three central features of the resulting model for organization of sports at the national level are (a) diminishment of the organizational hierarchy: participatory safety policy design is introduced through annual meetings where actors from different sectors of the sporting community discuss training, injury prevention, and sports safety policy; (b) introduction of a safety surveillance system: a ubiquitous system for routine collection of injury and illness data; and (c) an open forum for discussion of safety issues: maintenance of a safety forum for participants from different sectors of the sport. A nonhierarchical model for organization of sports at the national level - facilitated by modern information technology - adapted for the prevention of overuse injuries has been developed. Further research is warranted to evaluate the new organizational model in prospective effectiveness studies.

TI Sports related concussion: an emerging era in digital sports technology
SO NPJ DIGITAL MEDICINE
AB Sports-related concussion (SRC) is defined as a mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI) leading to complex impairment(s) in neurological function with many seemingly hidden or difficult to measure impairments that can deteriorate rapidly without any prior indication. Growing numbers of SRCs in professional and amateur contact sports have prompted closer dialog regarding player safety and welfare. Greater emphasis on awareness and education has improved SRC management, but also highlighted the difficulties of diagnosing SRC in a timely manner, particularly during matches or immediately after competition. Therefore, challenges exist in off-field assessment and return to play (RTP) protocols, with current traditional (subjective) approaches largely based on infrequent snapshot assessments. Low-cost digital technologies may provide more objective, integrated and personalized SRC assessment to better inform RTP protocols whilst also enhancing the efficiency and precision of healthcare assessment. To fully realize the potential of digital technologies in the diagnosis and management of SRC will require a significant paradigm shift in clinical practice and mindset. Here, we provide insights into SRC clinical assessment methods and the translational utility of digital approaches, with a focus on off-field digital techniques to detect key SRC metrics/biomarkers. We also provide insights and recommendations to the common benefits and challenges facing digital approaches as they aim to transition from novel technologies to an efficient, valid, reliable, and integrated clinical assessment tool for SRC. Finally, we highlight future opportunities that digital approaches have in SRC assessment and management including digital twinning and the "digital athlete".

AB Introduction: The perception of individuals with physical disabilities regarding assistive technology influences their occupational participation in adapted sports. Despite its widespread use, there is a lack of awareness about the role it plays in the occupational participation of Para-athletes. Objective: To explore the perceptions of individuals with physical disabilities regarding the use of assistive technology in occupational participation in adapted sports. Methodology: A qualitative research was conducted, using a constructionist approach and a phenomenological design. Purposive sampling was employed. Data was obtained through the application of semi-structured interviews to four individuals with physical disabilities practicing adapted sports in Santiago, Chile. Content analysis was performed, considering the perceptions present in the collected messages from a hermeneutic perspective. Results: It is emphasized that assistive technology plays a crucial role in occupational participation in adapted sports. Additionally, various types of technologies used, experiences and perceptions in their use, socio-economic and access barriers, accessibility barriers, facilitators, and support in occupational participation, as well as the associated physical and psychological benefits, are identified. Conclusion: The importance of ensuring equitable access to assistive technology for the occupational participation of individuals with physical disabilities in adapted sports is emphasized. There is a need to address socioeconomic and accessibility challenges to maximize the benefits of adapted sports for this group, through joint actions involving civil society, government, and healthcare professionals.

AB The natural-artificial distinction is not only an abstract metaphysical question dedicated to classifying and differentiating between entities and phenomena that occur in nature from man-made objects. The distinction between the natural and the artificial is central to the philosophy of technology and an interesting heuristic to discuss important notions about the growing process of technologization in sport. For example, if one accepts the natural-artificial distinction, one is against any genetic intervention to improve sports performance because one would consider it unnatural. In this article, I present an argument against the natural-artificial distinction and defend the ethical permissibility of the technologization of sport.

TI Coaches' Use of Remote Coaching: Experiences From Paralympic Sport
SO INTERNATIONAL SPORT COACHING JOURNAL
AB Remote coaching via the use of digital technologies has been utilized within Paralympic Sports since 2015 to address challenges experienced by coaches. These technologies have connected coaches and athletes in real time, alleviating time and travel costs. However, very little is known about the experience of coaching in these environments. Therefore, the aim of this study was to explore the experiences of coaches' use of remote coaching technologies. Seven coaches from five Paralympic Sports were recruited for this study and participated in semistructured interviews. Additionally, observations were conducted of remote coaching sessions that were part of their regular training schedules. Coaches' insights highlight that remote technologies created opportunities to increase coach-athlete interactions and positively impact the development of interpersonal relationships. This allowed coaches to explore and exploit newly discovered information from within training environments to aid athletes in skill development. Additionally, remote coaching provided unexpected opportunities for coach development. However, coaches also reported new environmental and logistical challenges which disrupted their usual coaching approach. Overall, remote coaching technologies were perceived as being beneficial despite the challenges experienced. However, future research that looks to understand how to impact coach and athlete development through the online environment is encouraged.

   introducing fuzzy comprehensive appraisal and artificial intelligence
   technology
SO EXPERT SYSTEMS
AB This article aims to improve the inefficiency of the sports service supply chain (SC) caused by the unscientific management of stakeholders in the sports service SC. First, combined with the literature, the identification and management of the service SC domestically and internationally are explained, providing a meaningful reference for improving sports service bases. Second, fuzzy comprehensive appraisal (FCA) algorithm process and artificial intelligence (AI) technology are used to evaluate and manage the risk of sports service SC. The FCA algorithm provides a comprehensive evaluation factor set for the sports service SC risk evaluation. Then, the complete evaluation set is established. To obtain the evaluation matrix, the 'expert' carries out fuzzy evaluation on each single factor. AI provides a data analysis platform for integrated SC risk management. The platform can realize the logical hierarchical relationship between indicators and rules, systematically standardize the sports service SC and rules, and conduct unified display, monitoring, and trend analysis. Finally, the FCA method is used to evaluate the risks of the sports service SC, and the results of the comprehensive management of the dangers of the SC are analysed. The results show that the evaluation indicators of sports service venues' SC service capabilities have a good consistency. The highest weight score of government service capability in the sports service SC is 0.2413, and the lowest weight score of the service capability index of the sports operation platform is 0.1708. Sports service venues' SC capacity in NANCHANG City is relatively average. This article deeply understands the structure of the sports service SC. It provides relevant basis and guidance for sports service integrators, service providers, and other market entities to adjust management strategies and improve market competitiveness. It also clarifies the risks and management results of the sports service SC, provides academic help for the researchers and enriches and develops the theory of the reform and construction of the Chinese sports service SC.

AB The aim of this research is to analyse the effect of a four-week strength programme using isoinertial technology on performance improvement in women in team sports on an intermittent basis. The sample was composed of six women with an average age of 21 (+/- 1.79 years). The tests of V-cut direction changes, explosive force counter movement jump and repeated sprint ability over 40 m were performed. The main results show that all the variables analysed are improved by training with isoinertial technology. They present significant differences (p<.05) in the variables of explosive strength and repeated sprint ability. Therefore, a strength training program using isoinertial technology during four weeks of training is sufficient for the improvement of direction changes, resistance to repeated sprinting and explosive leg strength.

The historical development of the technology in the sprint and in the javelin are discussed, from their introduction to the Olympics over two and a half thousand years ago to the current day. The rules pertaining to tennis racquets are described and the ways in which manufacturers and researchers attempt to maximize performance using technology are examined. Two models for a tennis racquet are shown, one in which the racquet is modelled as a rigid body and one in which it is modelled as a flexible beam. Use of the models shows that further advances in racquet technology using stiffer and lighter materials are unlikely to speed the game up. It was concluded that technology can be used by athletes and manufacturers to enhance performance. Equally, the ruling bodies of sport can also use technology to limit performance, leading to a delicate balance between technology and tradition.

SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
AB The aim of this study is to provide a form of educational technology sports and recreational competence of future specialists in physical culture and sports. To test the effectiveness of the technology a pedagogical experiment conducted at the Faculty of Physical Education of Tomsk State University. The criteria and indicators of formation of sports and recreational competence of students have the following components: motivational, cognitive, objectprofessional, analytical and reflective, communicative. To determine the level of formation of sports and recreation competence of students the cumulative score was used. Successful professional activities require modern specialists in physical culture and sports to show excellence, activity, creativity and in-depth knowledge and skills of both the subject-professional and the specific nature associated with the peculiarities of professional activities. The modern university graduate should be able to organize and conduct training with sports and recreational tasks for various population groups. This activity is called recreational in the federal educational standard of higher education. Sports and recreation activities are targets of sports and physical education, but in the educational process of sports higher schools and faculties training to prepare for implementation of this activity is not given due attention to. Underestimating physical recreation as a function of a specialist in physical culture is one side of the problem. The other is the lack of training of teachers for this activity. The purpose of the study is the creation of educational technology aimed at formation of sports and recreational competence of future specialists in physical culture. Formation of sports and recreational competence is assigned to a specific organizational structure, which acts as a manifestation of the levels of competence and has level features. At the heart of each level is the degree of formation of sports and recreational skills in the form of individual development of the student. To analyse the degree of formation of sports and recreational competence, we have developed four levels. The aim of our technology is to develop sports and recreational competence of future professionals. To achieve this goal we have developed a course of Physical Recreation. To test the effectiveness of the developed technological model for the formation of sports and recreational competence we made a pedagogical experiment, with the third year students (the experimental group of 20 persons) and the fifth year students (the control group of 20 persons) of the Faculty of Physical Education of Tomsk State University participating. The preliminary stage was conducted in order to determine the initial level of formation of sports and recreational competence of students in the control and experimental groups to use the experimental educational technology forming sports and recreational competence. At the next stage of the pedagogical experiment we used the developed educational technology in the educational process of the experimental group. The final stage of the pedagogical experiment revealed the changes in the formation of sports and recreational competence in the experimental group of students after having the course of Physical Recreation and assessed the dynamics of these changes in relation to the control group.
   As a result of the experimental work on the practical implementation of the technology of formation of sports and recreational competence of students of the Faculty of Physical Education it was established that in the experimental group, the values obtained for all components are higher than in the control group. The results of the pedagogical experiment confirm the positive impact of the developed and implemented technology of sports and recreational competence formation of students in the educational training of specialists in physical culture and sports.

AB Virtual Reality Spectatorship (VRS) is becoming an emerging sport media consumption trend as it delivers such optimal experience that maximizes user satisfaction. To clearly understand media user experiences in VRS, the current study aimed to investigate how a media (media type), personal (sport involvement), and game (rivalry) factors influence spectators' flow experience and to examine the impact of flow experience on their satisfaction. We conducted a 2 (media type: VR vs. 2-D screen) x 2 (rivalry: high vs. low) between subject experimental study where media type and rivalry were manipulated while sport involvement was measured. The results indicated that VRS amplified flow experience via vividness, interactivity, and telepresence to the greater extent than the traditional medium (2-D screen). Interestingly, sport viewers' sport involvement was found to amplify flow experience. Sport involvement also moderated the serial mediation (media -> vividness and interactivity -> telepresence -> flow experience); the effects of VR technology on flow experience was stronger for those who are less interested in the target sport than highly involved sport fans. Lastly, flow experience in VRS was found to substantially enhance user satisfaction.

TI How to Increase Sport Facility Users' Intention to Use AI Fitness
   Services: Based on the Technology Adoption Model
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Artificial intelligence (AI) has recently been introduced as a new way of analyzing and predicting sport consumer behavior. The goal of this study was to investigate the relationships among the perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, the importance of exercise, attitudes towards use, and the behavioral intention to use AI services based on the technology adoption model. The authors recruited 408 participants who participated in an experiment designed to provide a deeper understanding of AI fitness services. After screening, the collected data were screened through assumption tests, and we conducted a confirmatory factor analysis and structural equation modeling to analyze research hypotheses. The results indicated that three types of consumer evaluations (i.e., perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, and importance of exercise) positively influence their attitudes toward AI fitness services. In addition, the positive attitudes regarding AI services positively influenced the intention to use AI services. The results of this research contribute to our knowledge of the consumers' attitudes and behaviors toward AI services in the sport industry based on the technology acceptance model. Furthermore, this study provided the empirical evidence critically needed to increase our understanding of AI in the sport industry and offered new insights into how sport facility managers can predict their consumers' intention to use AI services.

TI Safeguarding Athletes Against Head Injuries Through Advances in
   Technology: A Scoping Review of the Uses of Machine Learning in the
   Management of Sports-Related Concussion
SO FRONTIERS IN SPORTS AND ACTIVE LIVING
AB Sports injury prevention is an important part of the athlete welfare and safeguarding research field. In sports injury prevention, sport-related concussion (SRC) has proved to be one of the most difficult and complex injuries to manage in terms of prevention, diagnosis, classification, treatment and rehabilitation. SRC can cause long-term health issues and is a commonly reported injury in both adult and youth athletes around the world. Despite increased knowledge of the prevalence of SRC, very few tools are available for diagnosing SRC in athletic settings. Recent technological innovations have resulted in different machine learning and deep learning methodologies being tested to improve the management of this complex sports injury. The purpose of this article is to summarize and map the existing research literature on the use of machine learning in the management of SRC, ascertain where there are gaps in the existing research and identify recommendations for future research. This is explored through a scoping review. A systematic search in the three electronic databases SPORTDiscus, PubMed and Scopus identified an initial 522 studies, of which 24 were included in the final review, the majority of which focused on machine learning for the prediction and prevention of SRC (N = 10), or machine learning for the diagnosis and classification of SRC (N = 11). Only 3 studies explored machine learning approaches for the treatment and rehabilitation of SRC. A main finding is that current research highlights promising practical uses (e.g., more accurate and rapid injury assessment or return-to-sport participation criteria) of machine learning in the management of SRC. The review also revealed a narrow research focus in the existing literature. As current research is primarily conducted on male adolescents or adults from team sports in North America there is an urgent need to include wider demographics in more diverse samples and sports contexts in the machine learning algorithms. If research datasets continue to be based on narrow samples of athletes, the development of any new diagnostic and predictive tools for SRC emerging from this research will be at risk. Today, these risks appear to mainly affect the health and safety of female athletes.

These include professional development activities of sport and leisure organizations; cultural innovations within sports and physical activities, which involve new spaces with new technologies; questions of public health; and questions of inclusion for marginal groups such as handicapped persons. Questions of power are important to understand each sport situation and each sport sociocultural, economic, and ecologic system. Behind the political and institutional instrumentalization of sport, the reality of social and cultural changes is rarely clear. Strong social, cultural, and economic forces continue to govern sports and seem to be more and more prominent. When sport scandals emerge, the media reveal the case, notably but not exclusively in the context of commercial interests. The possibility for a caring and respectful physical education experience and to improve inclusion for all (Gardou, C. (2012). La societe inclusive, parlons-en!

   performance?
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE
AB Background People with disabilities often depend on assistive devices to enable activities of daily living as well as to compete in sport. Technological developments in sport can be controversial.
   Objectives To review, identify and describe current technological developments in assistive devices used in the summer Paralympic Games; and to prepare for the London 2012 Games, the future challenges and the role of technology are debated.
   Methods A systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature and personal observations of technological developments at the Athens (2004) and Beijing (2008) Paralympic Games was conducted.
   Results Standard assistive devices can inhibit the Paralympians' abilities to perform the strenuous activities of their sports. Although many Paralympic sports only require technology similar to their Olympic counterparts, several unique technological modifications have been made in prosthetic and wheelchair devices. Technology is essential for the Paralympic athlete, and the potential technological advantage for a Paralympian, when competing against an Olympian, is unclear.
   Conclusion Technology must match the individual requirements of the athlete with the sport in order for Paralympians to safely maximise their performance. Within the 'performance enhancement or essential for performance?' debate, any potential increase in mechanical performance from an assistive device must be considered holistically with the compensatory consequences the disability creates. To avoid potential technology controversies at the 2012 London Olympic and Paralympic Games, the role of technology in sport must be clarified.

AB Gabbett, TJ. Quantifying the physical demands of collision sports: does microsensor technology measure what it claims to measure? J Strength Cond Res 27(8): 2319-2322, 2013The physical demands of rugby league, rugby union, and American football are significantly increased through the large number of collisions players are required to perform during match play. Because of the labor-intensive nature of coding collisions from video recordings, manufacturers of wearable microsensor (e.g., global positioning system [GPS]) units have refined the technology to automatically detect collisions, with several sport scientists attempting to use these microsensors to quantify the physical demands of collision sports. However, a question remains over the validity of these microtechnology units to quantify the contact demands of collision sports. Indeed, recent evidence has shown significant differences in the number of impacts recorded by microtechnology units (GPSports) and the actual number of collisions coded from video. However, a separate study investigated the validity of a different microtechnology unit (minimaxX; Catapult Sports) that included GPS and triaxial accelerometers, and also a gyroscope and magnetometer, to quantify collisions. Collisions detected by the minimaxX unit were compared with video-based coding of the actual events. No significant differences were detected in the number of mild, moderate, and heavy collisions detected via the minimaxX units and those coded from video recordings of the actual event. Furthermore, a strong correlation (r = 0.96, p < 0.01) was observed between collisions recorded via the minimaxX units and those coded from video recordings of the event. These findings demonstrate that only one commercially available and wearable microtechnology unit (minimaxX) can be considered capable of offering a valid method of quantifying the contact loads that typically occur in collision sports. Until such validation research is completed, sport scientists should be circumspect of the ability of other units to perform similar functions.

AB Sport management field has been growing in recent years and more Sport Sciences graduates are employed within this field. For that reason, it seems interesting to analyse the current situation of the sport management subjects within the Sports Sciences Degrees to enhance sport graduates' employability into this area. This paper aims to offer an overview of sport management subjects enclosed by the Sports Sciences degrees, both in public and private Spanish universities. A total of 219 subjects related to sport management were extracted from the website of the Spanish Min-istry of Science, Innovation and Universities and data was codified and analysed using descriptive and content analysis.

TI Analysis on the Psychological Effect of Interactive Integration of
   International Sports Organizations and Sports Tourism
SO REVISTA DE PSICOLOGIA DEL DEPORTE
AB This paper centres on the psychological impact of sports tourism, delineating its characteristics, connotations, and associated effects. It emphasizes that sports tourism achieves psychological outcomes among tourists through mechanisms such as diversion, moderate fatigue, physical enhancement, and character cultivation. These mechanisms underscore its significance as a crucial, civilized, and pragmatic fitness approach aimed at fostering individual well-being, longevity, and personal growth. Furthermore, it underscores the relevance of research into the psychological effects resulting from the interactive integration of sports tourism within the public domain, particularly investigations into the interplay between international sports organizations and sports tourism on public psychology. This study focuses on the integrated advancement of the sports industry and tourism within a specific province. It is discerned that the sports industry in this province exhibits a noticeable disparity compared to regions with more robust development, indicating a lack of alignment with overall economic progress, thereby necessitating expedited development efforts. Among these initiatives, integration with the tourism sector emerges as particularly pivotal. The research predominantly relies on data sourced from the China National Knowledge Network (CNKI) and relevant university library websites. A total of 380 literature resources pertaining to sports industry integration and 130 resources concerning the integration of the sports industry with tourism were gathered, alongside 60 dissertations. This paper delves into the integrated development of the sports industry and tourism within the province, revealing the existing gap between its sports industry and those of more developed provinces, highlighting the incongruity with broader economic trajectories. The confluence of sports and tourism is pronounced, facilitating reciprocal enrichment and the realization of shared benefits. Together, they foster a symbiotic relationship marked by the cultivation of a congenial milieu, the facilitation of social cohesion, and the augmentation of emotional engagement. Industrial integration, on the other hand, represents a developmental paradigm wherein diverse industries harmonize their industrial technologies, managerial practices, marketing resources, and market penetration strategies through collaborative restructuring initiatives under specific circumstances. Such endeavours transcend the constraints inherent in faltering sectors, drawing upon policy frameworks for support, leveraging cultural dynamics as a facilitative medium, and harnessing developmental imperatives while utilizing resources as conduits for advancement. The convergence of the sports and tourism industries signifies a forthcoming developmental trajectory. Market demand acts as a catalyst for integration, while resource sharing establishes the groundwork for such amalgamation. Interconnectedness and mutual reinforcement underscore the fundamental nature of fusion, with advancements in science and technology providing the requisite foundation for fusion-based technologies. The confluence of developmental pathways anticipates the potential for sustained fusion-driven progress.

TI First international consensus statement on sports psychiatry
SO SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE & SCIENCE IN SPORTS
AB Sports psychiatry is a young field of medicine and psychiatry that focuses on mental health among athletes, and sports and exercise within psychiatry and mental disorders. However, the development of sports psychiatry and its fields of activity vary from region to region and are not uniform yet. Sports psychiatry and the role of sports psychiatrists have also already been discussed in the field of sports and exercise medicine, and within medical teams in competitive and elite sports. A uniform definition on sports psychiatry, its fields of activity, sports psychiatrist, and the essential knowledge, skills, and abilities (plus attitudes, eKSA+A) of the sports psychiatrist were developed as part of an International Society for Sports Psychiatry (ISSP) Summit, as well as First International Consensus Statement on Sports Psychiatry. Three fields of activity can be distinguished within sports psychiatry: (i) mental health and disorders in competitive and elite sports, (ii) sports and exercise in prevention of and treatment for mental disorders, and (iii) mental health and sport-specific mental disorders in recreational sports. Each of these fields have its own eKSA+A. The definitions on sports psychiatry and sports psychiatrists, as well as the framework of eKSA+A in the different fields of activity of sports psychiatrists will help to unify and standardize the future development of sports psychiatry, establish a standard of service within sports psychiatry and together with the neighboring disciplines, and should be included into current, and future sports psychiatry education and training.

TI Web-Based Communication of Wooden Sport Equipment: An Analysis Based on
   Six Olympic Sports
SO FORESTS
AB Wood has traditionally been used to make sports equipment and playing surfaces. While its use is outdated in several sports, in many others, wood remains well-established or even the material of choice, e.g., to make basketball floors or table tennis rackets. This study aims at evaluating the main drivers of web-based communication of wooden sport equipment. Six Olympic sports in which wood is still used were identified: baseball, skateboarding, skiing, snowboarding, surfboarding, and table tennis. For each sport, five websites of manufacturers were selected based on their page rank. Five evaluators assessed each website, rating the degree to which their discussion of wood intersected with four dimensions (and the related sub-dimensions): environment and ethics, design, wood technology, and communication. Significant differences (p < 0.05) are found among the dimensions, where communication and wood technology scored the higher ratings. Several differences are found among sub-dimensions, for instance in terms of attention given to environmental and social sustainability. Among the various findings, environmental and social sustainability, based on a proper commitment, is a relevant target for the web-based communication of manufacturers of wooden sport equipment. We argue that this is both for ethical reasons, and for market and image purposes.

TI Training perceptual-cognitive skills in sports using technology
SO JOURNAL OF SPORT PSYCHOLOGY IN ACTION
AB Ballistically reactive sports performances such as blocking a soccer or hockey shot-on-goal, returning a tennis serve, and hitting a pitched baseball or bowled cricket ball depend upon anticipating an opponent's action. Sport science researchers have found that expert performers in many sports use superior perceptual-cognitive skills to recognize patterns in opponents' actions, thereby priming rapid response selection and motor execution. Researchers have developed technologies and methods for measuring perceptual-cognitive skills that can also be used to improve these skills. After decades of research, technologies are now appearing as viable training products that coaches and sport psychologists can use with athletes. This article describes technologies such as visual occlusion, virtual reality, and 3D multiple object tracking for training perceptual-cognitive sport skills.

This article extends relevant research from intra-state to including cross-board cases by combing data of merger and acquisition (M&A) in global sports and health industries as well as the country-level digital adoption index. It is shown that the integration in sports and health industries is positively associated with the digital technology adoption that the country in which the acquiror firm is located. Thus, it is beneficial for policymakers to promote the digital technology use when aiming to encourage the spontaneous industrial integration in sports and health industries.

SO INTERDISCIPLINARY JOURNAL OF MANAGEMENT STUDIES
AB This study aims to investigate the attention cognitive process while watching sports advertisements in interested and non-interested people using electroencephalogram technology. The research method was semi-experimental and the population included 30 students of Birjand University who were selected randomly as a sample. To collect data, the General Health and Sanchez-Torres Questionnaire (2021) was used. Then to record the brain signal, the 21-channel Electroencephalography Instrument was used. The results revealed a significant difference in attention index (AI) between sports advertising and non-sport advertising. Also, the attention index in people who were interested in sports showed a significant difference compared to those who were not. It can be concluded that sports are a suitable platform for advertising products so that it can create a positive effect through increasing the customers' attention. The level of interest also in sports may be a persuasive calculation of consideration for publicizing.

TI WHAT'S WRONG WITH GENETIC INEQUALITY? THE IMPACT OF GENETIC TECHNOLOGY
   ON ELITE SPORTS AND SOCIETY
SO SPORT ETHICS AND PHILOSOPHY
AB Advances in genetic technology will enable us to intervene in human biological development to prevent and cure diseases, to restore individuals' functions and capacities back to a normal level after injury and even to enhance them beyond what has hitherto been considered as normal functioning for our species. Such a power to reshape and modify the human condition raises fundamental questions that touch upon the central core of morality. One of these questions is distributive justice. Will all people have equal access to the beneficial effects of genetic technology in general and medical genetics in particular? Most of the new therapeutic and enhancement techniques will probably be quite expensive. That means that, probably during a long period of time after the new genetic technology enters medical practice, its use will be practically monopolized by the rich, to the detriment of all those who are not in a position to afford genetic treatments. In this paper, I argue that the health care inequality that inevitably will follow from the adoption of genetic technology, while posing a challenge to provide as long as possible for genetic interventions for all, is hardly a reason to reject the new technology. In that case, we would have to reject any new medicine or medical technique that cannot be made available to all people at once. Finally, I also argue that the 'enhanced new world' that would follow the introduction of genetic technology, even with the kind of inequality that might then arise, poses no serious threat either to elite sports or to society and should therefore be welcome.

TI The Use of Wearable Sensor Technology to Detect Shock Impacts in Sports
   and Occupational Settings: A Scoping Review
SO SENSORS
AB Shock impacts during activity may cause damage to the joints, muscles, bones, or inner organs. To define thresholds for tolerable impacts, there is a need for methods that can accurately monitor shock impacts in real-life settings. Therefore, the main aim of this scoping review was to present an overview of existing methods for assessments of shock impacts using wearable sensor technology within two domains: sports and occupational settings. Online databases were used to identify papers published in 2010-2020, from which we selected 34 papers that used wearable sensor technology to measure shock impacts. No studies were found on occupational settings. For the sports domain, accelerometry was the dominant type of wearable sensor technology utilized, interpreting peak acceleration as a proxy for impact. Of the included studies, 28 assessed foot strike in running, head impacts in invasion and team sports, or different forms of jump landings or plyometric movements. The included studies revealed a lack of consensus regarding sensor placement and interpretation of the results. Furthermore, the identified high proportion of validation studies support previous concerns that wearable sensors at present are inadequate as a stand-alone method for valid and accurate data on shock impacts in the field.

In this context, smart sports has become a new trend in sports development. This paper creates an intelligent learning environment and builds a smart sports platform through advanced concepts and technical means, which can effectively optimize the integration and sharing of sports resources. Starting from the overall architecture design of smart sports, the key technologies of machine learning model to realize smart sports are sorted out. Through the five basic linking stages with machine learning model as the core, the value innovation path of platform construction structure is analyzed. The current status of sports resources application is studied, and the data mining algorithm is used to calculate the user usage data of the smart sports platform and improve the construction of the smart platform. Through the construction of the smart sports platform, people shift from traditional reading books and watching TV programs to getting information through intelligent mobile terminals, and the proportion of attention to sports information is as high as 58.6%. This shows that by building a smart sports platform, it can provide support and guarantee for the sustainable development of sports.

Modified perceptual training (MPT) collectively describes on- or off field sports training tasks that are specifically designed to develop visual and perceptual-cognitive skill. Traditional training approaches in sport include sports vision training and perceptual-cognitive training, while recently, new technologies have enabled a broad range of additional MPT tools to become available to coaches and athletes.
   Design: Short literature review and opinion article.
   Methods: Literature in the fields of sports vision training and perceptual-cognitive training are summarised and contrasted. A selection of emerging MPT technologies are then overviewed. This leads to the identification of three interacting factors of MPT task design that may influence the task's capacity to transfer improved training performance to actual competition: (i) the targeted perceptual function, (ii) stimulus correspondence, and (iii) response correspondence, which are assimilated with key tenets of representative learning design.
   Results: These three theoretically-grounded differences are adopted to support and justify the structure of the Modified Perceptual Training Framework which sets out predictions for future research to test in order to clarify the transfer effect of MPT tools.
   Conclusions: The application of the Modified Perceptual Training Framework may assist in future testing, design and selection of beneficial training tools in sport and as such, is predicted to have significant impact in empirical and practical settings.

The vigorous development of the IoT has been applied in many fields, among which, especially the data mining technology of the IoT ushered in the spring of this era of information explosion. Full application of data mining technology can provide real data well. Application analysis provides value and decision support. In order to apply 5G Internet of Things technology to the sports industry to help study the multi-index data of various sports activities so as to better help modern people have a healthy sports concept, Nemo builds relevant data analysis based on 5G Internet of Things technology. This article analyzes the research on the construction of sports multi-index data based on 5G IoT, makes full use of the IoT to mine sports-related data, and launches a multi-index discussion on it. First, the literature data method is adopted to learn the theoretical knowledge of IoT, artificial neural network, deep learning, etc., and establish a sports multi-index data analysis research model based on machine learning and massive data processing technology. Finally, for modern people, sports hobbies, types, exercise duration, exercise heart rate, and other aspects are analyzed. The results show that modern people prefer aerobic exercise, especially jogging and cycling, accounting for 47% and 41%, and the proportion of people who spend more than 60 minutes in the gym is as high as 48%. This shows that even though most people are busy at work, they still realize the importance of physical exercise and are willing to do sports.

TI Examining multidimensional sport-confidence in athletes and non-athlete
   sport performers
SO JOURNAL OF SPORTS SCIENCES
AB Sport-confidence is considered a critical success factor for sport performers at all levels. Researchers have suggested that sport-confidence is a multidimensional rather than a unidimensional construct, and the sport-confidence model identified three types of sport-confidence (i.e., physical skills and training, cognitive efficiency, and resilience) that are important for success in sport. However, such multidimensionality of sport-confidence and its measurement have not been fully examined. On a large sample of sport performers with varied skill levels and characteristics, the purpose of the present study was to examine the three-factor model of sport-confidence. We tested the measurement invariance of the Sport-Confidence Inventory across 512 athletes and 1170 non-athlete sport performers. Results from the multiple group model analysis showed that the three-factor model of sport-confidence fit better for the athlete sample than for the non-athlete sample. The results implicate that the three-factor model of sport-confidence model is suitable to athletes, though sport-confidence may appear more unidimensional for non-athletes. The use of the Sport-Confidence Inventory for non-athlete sport performers demands further consideration; however, the findings implicate that it could be a useful tool to assess sport-confidence of sport performers at any levels.

TI Performance Expectancy of Officiating Technology in Spector-Based Sport
   Events: Scale Development and Validation
SO COMMUNICATION & SPORT
AB In an effort to decrease the number of missed calls and to improve officiating during sport events, various sports leagues have implemented media technology (e.g., Video Assistant Referee, Hawk-Eye). More importantly, the use of officiating technology has significantly influenced spectatorship in various ways (e.g., perception of and attitude toward the technology). Although officiating technology is an impressive tool for communicating final decisions to spectators, few scholars have examined how spectators perceive the use of officiating technology, and no psychometric measurement scale exists that measures this perception. To fill this void, we developed and validated the Performance Expectancy of Officiating Technology (PEOT) scale to measure the perceptions of spectators, one of the most important stakeholder groups in the industry. We identified four sub-dimensions of PEOT: fair judgment, enjoyability, efficient game operation, and convenience of review; a multi-dimensional framework that provides a psychometrically sound approach to assessment. The results reveal that PEOT had a positive and direct impact on attitude toward and intention to watch sport events. In addition, attitude partially mediated the relationship between performance expectancy and intention to watch sport events. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.

TI New Media, Professional Sport and Political Economy
SO JOURNAL OF SPORT & SOCIAL ISSUES
AB New media technologies are seen to be changing the production, delivery and consumption of professional sports and creating a new dynamic between sports fans, athletes, clubs, governing bodies and the mainstream media. However, as Bellamy and McChesney (2011) have pointed out, advances in digital technologies are taking place within social, political, and economic contexts that are strongly conditioning the course and shape of this communication revolution. This essay assesses the first wave of research on professional sport and new media technologies and concludes that early trends indicate the continuation of existing neoliberal capitalist tendencies within professional sport. Using the concept of political economy, the essay explores issues of ownership, structure, production and delivery of sport. Discussion focuses on the opportunities sports fans now have available to them and how sports organization and media corporations shifted from an initial position of uncertainty, that bordered on hostility, to one which has seen them embrace new media technologies as powerful marketing tools. The essay concludes by stating as fundamental the issues of ownership and control and advocates that greater cognizance be accorded to underlying economic structures and the enduring, all-pervasive power of neoliberal capitalism and its impact in professional sport.

AB This study systematically reviewed the available scientific evidence pertaining to the different types of prototypes available, discussed their current use, and present and future applications in sports science. The electronic databases National Library of Medicine (PubMed), Web of Science & TRADE; and Scopus were searched from January 2016 to September 2021. Of the 750 articles identified, 714 articles were excluded based on title and abstract and/or for duplicates. Moreover, of the 36 articles selected, 11 articles (30.5%) were related to the development of prototypes for carrying out tactical-technical or physical performance analyzes of athletes in different sports, 22 articles (61.1%) were related to the creation of "equipment or clothing" prototypes used in sports activities and three articles (8.3%) were related to the creation of prototypes that aim to improve the technical performance of athletes. It was concluded that the development of prototypes in sport had a significant impact on the monitoring of athletes in the field of sport sciences. The prototypes provide coaches and technical professionals with the monitoring of physiological, tactical-technical, and physical parameters in real time during training and sports competitions. These parameters can be used for recognition of movement patterns and prevention of potential injuries, such as concussion and fatigue.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPORTS MARKETING & SPONSORSHIP
AB PurposeTo extend research into sport consumer behaviors related to online sports betting, this study is designed to identify and examine the relationship between online sports betting motivations and online sports betting intentions. By applying a push-pull framework from online sport consumption and gambling studies, nine motivations to engage in online sports betting were identified. These motivations were hypothesized to motivate online sports betting intentions.Design/methodology/approachA quota sampling technique based on the sports bettor demographics available in the American Gaming Association (AGA, 2019) and the Pew Research Center (2022) obtained a total of 550 completed surveys that met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. For data analyses, confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM) were used to examine the measurement model and the hypothesized model, respectively.FindingsThe results revealed that four motivations (i.e. monetary gain, excitement, convenience and negative technology-readiness) were related to online sports betting intention, while five motivations (i.e. sport fandom, positive technology-readiness, impulsivity, socialization and promotion) were not.Originality/valueThe results provide foundational theoretical knowledge of what motivates sports fans to participate in online sports betting. Furthermore, the findings assist practitioners in their allocation of resources by enhancing their understanding of online sports betting motivations.

TI Assessing the need to use sport supplements: The mediating role of
   sports supplement beliefs
SO PERFORMANCE ENHANCEMENT & HEALTH
AB Aim: Sport supplement use by athletes can lead to unintentional anti-doping rule violations (ADRVs) due to the contamination of prohibited substances. This phenomenon underscores the need for athletes to reconsider their supplement use and assess their safety, efficacy, and necessity-a process we referred to as 'reconsideration of supplement use'. Additionally, a body of research using the Sport Supplement Beliefs Scale (SSBS) has shown that when an athlete believes that supplements improve performance, they may be more likely to progress to doping in the future. However, most research is conducted in English speaking countries and there is a lack of validated measures in other languages. Therefore, in this multi-study research, we validated a Japanese version of the SSBS (Study 1) and examined relationships between perceived risk of ADRV due to supplements, reconsideration of supplement use, sports supplement beliefs and sport supplement use (Study 2). Methods: In Study 1, we created a Japanese version of the SSBS (SSBS-J) using back-translation. In order to evaluate the reliability and validity of the scale, we utilized data from 356 university athletes, which were divided into two distinct cohorts, who reported their frequency and number of supplements used. Internal consistency and fit of the SSBS-J were evaluated using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and the scale's ability to determine supplement use was assessed using linear regression analysis and t-tests. In Study 2, 525 university athletes (64.6 % men, M-age = 18.7 +/- 0.7 years) were asked to complete measures related to the perceived risk of committing an ADRV due to supplement use, SSBS-J and sport supplement use. Results: In Study 1, the SSBS-J showed high internal consistency (alpha = 0.876), a one-factor structure similar to the original version, and good model fit. Linear regression indicated that the SSBS-J scores were significantly associated with the frequency and number of supplements used and differences were found between scores of supplement users (21.51 +/- 6.54) and non-users (16.48 +/- 6.14) (p < .001). Discriminant analysis correctly classified 64.7 % of supplement users and 61.0 % of non-users. In Study 2, ADRV awareness was indirectly related to sport supplement use via sport supplement beliefs (p < .001). Conclusions: Our findings suggest that ADRV awareness can influence reconsideration of supplement use and subsequently deter supplement use mediated by sport supplement beliefs. These insights emphasize the importance of promoting doping risk awareness, revisiting supplement use, and mitigating sport supplement beliefs to reduce inappropriate or unnecessary supplement use among athletes. From an anti-doping perspective, this insight is valuable in guiding athlete education regarding supplement use.

TI Sport event innovativeness: Conceptualization, measurement, and its
   impact on consumer behavior
SO SPORT MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB Although scholars have had a long-standing interest in product innovation based on technological development, limited attention has been devoted to the study of the innovation of sport event experiences. Two quantitative studies, from the consumer's perspective, were completed to validate the proposed conceptualization of sport event innovativeness composed of six dimensions (player performance, respectful access, self-service technology, aesthetic environment, fan community, and loyalty program), and to examine the hypothesized relationships impacting consumer behavior. Including the dimensions of player performance, fan community, and loyalty program, extends previous research that has focused primarily on technology and process-based innovations. The results indicate the effects of the six dimensions on overall innovativeness are contingent on a consumer's age. The ideas merit further research with respect to formulating an explanation of what factors contribute most to connecting consumers to sport organizations through innovative sport event experiences.

AB Through literature study, this paper discusses the difficulties and countermeasures of sports culture communication in China under the background of sports globalization. It is believed that the rapid expansion of capital and technology modernization has accelerated the spread and exchange of sports culture which shows the complementarity of identity and diversity. The communication of China's sports culture is restricted by identity and is strongly influenced by western transnational capital, with an obvious feature of westernization. The intellectual property (IP) rights in sports have not yet formed an effective circular operation, and the defects of the system are still huge constraints on the spread of sports culture in China. The way to enhance the vitality of China's sports culture lies in diversity. Under the condition that the "de-administration" of sports management has not been completed, it can help us spread sports culture more confidently by taking sports enterprises as the leader and focusing on the capital operation and creative production of sports IP at home and abroad.

AB Over the last years, the European sports sector has seen many changes that have affected the areas of management, economics, employment and technological progress. According to recent scientific studies, the key factors in the development of the European sports sector include the rise in sports activities, globalization, new technologies and the aging of the population. The importance of sport has also increased since European governments have begun to invest more in this sector for its positive role. These reasons change the character of the perception of sport as a new scientific discipline and hence of the industry that has its considerable economic power. At the same time, it is necessary to look at this industry from the managerial point of view, considering the specificities that are typical for the management of organizations operating in sport. The aim of this paper is to point out the new trends in management in sports industry in Slovakia and in the world under the influence of globalization. During the creation of this article was analysed many of foreign scientific literature and expert articles dealing with issues of management and economic in sport, as well as issues that are closely related to the area under consideration. In addition, were used surveys and interviews with representatives of sports in Slovakia.

Design/methodology/approach This exploratory study performs semi-structured interviews with retail managers of sports equipment stores. Findings This research reveals the importance of the dimensions of immersive design, sensorial ambient elements, social relationships, trialability and real experience sharing in designing a memorable in-store shopping experience in sports stores, and it highlights that the store's role in the sports context is transitioning from sales space to an interactive, immersive, engaging and convivial place. It proposes a model to design the in-store customer shopping experience effectively. Practical implications Sports equipment managers can make their physical stores as experiential as possible by investing in expert, passionate personnel and technology in order to create a real in-store experience of the product and the sports practice. Originality/value While sports equipment retailers acknowledge the importance of providing customers with a memorable shopping experience by creating an evocative environment and placing multiple touchpoints in stores, management scholars have paid limited attention to sports stores. This study explores the ways in which sports retail managers can design their stores effectively in experiential terms.

SO QUEST
AB This paper is based on a keynote lecture delivered at the International Association of Physical Education in Higher Education 2011 Conference, University of Limerick, on the sub theme: Technologies in Support of Physical Education, Sport, and Physical Activity. The paper outlines and illustrates a framework: narrative technology, which can be used for designing computing to support and enhance physical education, sport and physical activity. The framework is based on a ternary of foundational concepts: (1) physical engagement, (2) narrative, and (3) interactive technology. The paper outlines the theoretical basis of the approach, which is informed by contemporary debates and themes in education and educational technology, including: narratology, embodied design (or design for embodiment), and interactivity. Furthermore, from an empirical and practical perspective, two examples of the use of different types of computing are presented and discussed. The first intervention that is outlined focuses on the use of novel ubiquitous computing to enhance physical engagement, interpretation and interactivity. The second instantiation of computing illustrates how more widely available, "everyday'' technologies can be used to support and enhance large-scale creative and collaborative physical education. The purpose of the paper is to demonstrate current and future potential of technology, and support creative and novel perspectives on how information and communications technologies can be used to enhance physical education, sport and physical activity.

AB Technology nowadays makes a huge impact on education in all its aspects. It can provide objective data in fields of study where subjectivity was a concern. In this respect we aim to demonstrate using technology that practicing sports on a daily basis have a positive influence on psycho motor development of children. Among the psychomotor components we choose to study balance. We used an Amti netforce cell to evaluate the balance of 1st grade pupils. This platform records the projection of the mass center of the tested subject on three axes. There are different stances used to evaluate balance. The experiment hypothesis is that the practice of sport like activities daily during the school week will improve the balance of children. In the experiment we consider two groups. A control group who performs physical activities normal for a 6 to 7 years old child and the experimental group who. performs sport activities daily at least from Monday to Friday as a duty because they are enrolled in a sport program school. We need the control group in order to be able to identify, the aging related psycho motor development. The duration of the experiment was one year. We evaluated both groups using Amti NetForce cell at the beginning and the end of this period The collected data is statistically analyzed in order to see if there is a significant difference between the final and initial moment of the experiment and between the two groups. We expect to prove our experiment hypothesis so offering an objective proof of the positive influence of sports on the psycho motor development of children and implicitly of their education

   undergraduates
SO JOURNAL OF CHINESE SOCIOLOGY
AB With the development of digital technology, the proportion of time spent on digital informal learning in students' daily lives is increasing. However, digital informal learning behaviors in sports field have not been fully justified and studied. This article aims to investigate the current situation and influencing factors of digital informal learning of sports knowledge (DIL-S) of Chinese undergraduates. As a cross-sectional study, 401 non-sports undergraduate students from six Chinese universities completed the DIL-S measurement questionnaire. The partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM) was constructed to explore association among DIL-S, technology expectancy (TE) and digital competence (DC). Results show that (1) Male students' cognitive learning (CL) was significantly better than that of females; Senior students' metacognitive learning (MCL) was significantly better than that of junior students; Sports university students' cognitive learning, metacognitive learning, and social and motivation learning (SML) were significantly better than that of non-sports university students. (2) Digital competence has a significant positive impact on technology expectancy and digital informal learning of sport knowledge, while technology expectancy has a significant negative impact on digital informal learning of sport knowledge. Based on the results, following conclusions can be made (1) Undergraduates have a strong competence to use digital technology and have a high interest in using digital technology to participate in learning. However, they have a low investment in digital informal learning of sports knowledge fields. (2) Males' sports knowledge learning consciousness and actual performance are better than girls; Compared with freshmen, senior students have stronger monitoring and planning ability for personal sports knowledge learning; The behavior of digital informal learning of sports knowledge in sports university students is better than that of non-sports university students. (3) Digital competence and technological expectancy are key factors influencing digital informal learning of sport knowledge, with digital competence having the most significant impact. These findings underscore the need to enhance the promotion of digital informal learning among undergraduates and to develop assessments that improve their understanding and knowledge of sports.

SO BMJ OPEN SPORT & EXERCISE MEDICINE
AB The Tokyo 2020 Olympic Games is expected to be among the hottest Games in modern history, increasing the chances for exertional heat stroke (EHS) incidence, especially in non-acclimatised athletes/workers/spectators. The urgent need to recognise EHS symptoms to protect all attendees' health has considerably accelerated research examining the most effective cooling strategies and the development of wearable cooling technology and real-time temperature monitoring. While these technological advances will aid the early identification of EHS cases, there are several potential ethical considerations for governing bodies and sports organisers. For example, the impact of recently developed cooling wearables on health and performance is unknown. Concerning improving athletic performance in a hot environment, there is uncertainty about this technology's availability to all athletes. Furthermore, the real potential to obtain real-time core temperature data will oblige medical teams to make crucial decisions around their athletes continuing their competitions or withdraw. Therefore, the aim of this review is (1) to summarise the practical applications of the most novel cooling strategies/technologies for both safety (of athletes, spectators and workers) and performance purposes, and (2) to inform of the opportunities offered by recent technological developments for the early recognition and diagnosis of EHS. These opportunities are presented alongside several ethical dilemmas that require sports governing bodies to react by regulating the validity of recent technologies and their availability to all.

AB The sports training process is a complex system including multi-link and multi-factor, with many possibilities for development. The coach can get the different training results while he adopts different control level. Because of the development of modem scientific theory and technology we can control the whole process of sports training and make them toward a more scientific direction. This paper shows that we can achieve scientization in the sports training process from three levels. Firstly, at the macro level, the minds of scientific training should be improved among the coach. Secondly, at the meso level, the connotation of scientific training should be understood accurately. Thirdly, in the micro level, the whole sports training process should be controlled and conducted in accordance with expected direction. As the basic method and means, feedback is used by coach in the sports training process, and load control, information control and model control are the basic strategies in the training process. The scientization in sports training is a dynamic changing process; it has the obvious characteristics of the time and with no terminal point. The new connotation and evaluation criteria are added constantly as a result of development of modem scientific theory and technology, and in this way we are able to achieve dynamic goals of scientization in sports training according to the three levels in any time.

AB The dualism of design and use is deconstructed in the transformative critical room "Elitesport", one of the experimental spaces of enhancement technologies. This article pleads for the empowerment of athletes by giving them personal responsibility for their bodies and the release of enhancement technologies into their power of disposal under the condition that they are fully aware of all consequences and risks. The users of the technology, the athletes are the designers of their body transformation and as such, they should have the right of self-determination in the way they want to change their own body. Such an approach would also open up a fair and individualized participation of all athletes in all competitions, regardless of gender, without having to exclude disabled people with high-tech protheses, cyborgs with robotic applications or anyone else as monsters or aliens. The redesign of the Apparatus "competition" would be the prerequisite for athletes to act on their own responsibility. The Apparatus "competition" could make the critical-transformative space "elite sport" and the unlimited useable enhancement technologies reliable; trustworthy and leavable. Gender meanings can be renegotiated and this could lead to gender differentiation.

TI Sports activity detection, organization and evaluation in online to
   offline sports community
SO COGNITIVE SYSTEMS RESEARCH
AB Although new technologies such as IoT and mobile Internet inspired progress on sports community, online communications among exercisers are still deficient and relationships between exercisers and sports activities are absent. An Online to Offline (O2O) sports community was proposed to solve these problems. In such a novel sports community, various sports activities are the basis of online communications and offline experiences, and their detection, organization and evaluation are key issues. Firstly, the basic composition and construction process of sports activity ecology are described. Next, contents and organization principles of various sports activities along with the activity organization procedures consisting of activity primary election, final election, running and evaluation stages are described. Then, mediums, procedures and data crawling methods of activity intention detection are discussed. Finally, an effect evaluation framework for sports activities, which includes material analysis, expert evaluation and effect investigation, is designed. The idea and procedures of sentiment analysis based material analysis along with sentiment dictionary constitution and sentiment words handling are presented in details. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

TI Sustainable Management of the Public Financial Model for Sports Support
   in Slovakia
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB Sports represent an undeniable value associated with people's health and leisure time. Therefore, research on sports management related to the overall setting of a sustainable sports funding model from public resources is vital. This article's aim was to evaluate the sustainability of this form of sports funding in Slovakia. Since there is no complete, transparent database of the allocated subsidies at the national, regional, and local levels in this country, an important part of the research was the collection of diverse pieces of data. As part of the methodology, the research combines geographical and temporal comparisons of public sports funding at all levels of management. Multiple interviews with members of the professional sports community also provided important qualitative inputs. Due to the identified shortcomings in the current state of the model of public sports funding in Slovakia, it is considered unsustainable. Therefore, the article also contains specific recommendations for the improvement and gradual removal of the identified sustainability barriers. These implications lead to the future creation of a database clearly capturing public sports funding, with rules for its permanent operation and updating. To strengthen the transparency aspect, the database can be powered by blockchain technology.

TI Acute evaluation of sport-related concussion and implications for the
   Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT6) for adults, adolescents and
   children: a systematic review
SO BRITISH JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE
AB ObjectivesTo systematically review the scientific literature regarding the acute assessment of sport-related concussion (SRC) and provide recommendations for improving the Sport Concussion Assessment Tool (SCAT6). Data sourcesSystematic searches of seven databases from 2001 to 2022 using key words and controlled vocabulary relevant to concussion, sports, SCAT, and acute evaluation. Eligibility criteria(1) Original research articles, cohort studies, case-control studies, and case series with a sample of >10; (2) & GE;80% SRC; and (3) studies using a screening tool/technology to assess SRC acutely (<7 days), and/or studies containing psychometric/normative data for common tools used to assess SRC. Data extractionSeparate reviews were conducted involving six subdomains: Cognition, Balance/Postural Stability, Oculomotor/Cervical/Vestibular, Emerging Technologies, and Neurological Examination/Autonomic Dysfunction. Paediatric/Child studies were included in each subdomain. Risk of Bias and study quality were rated by coauthors using a modified SIGN (Scottish Intercollegiate Guidelines Network) tool. ResultsOut of 12 192 articles screened, 612 were included (189 normative data and 423 SRC assessment studies). Of these, 183 focused on cognition, 126 balance/postural stability, 76 oculomotor/cervical/vestibular, 142 emerging technologies, 13 neurological examination/autonomic dysfunction, and 23 paediatric/child SCAT. The SCAT discriminates between concussed and non-concussed athletes within 72 hours of injury with diminishing utility up to 7 days post injury. Ceiling effects were apparent on the 5-word list learning and concentration subtests. More challenging tests, including the 10-word list, were recommended. Test-retest data revealed limitations in temporal stability. Studies primarily originated in North America with scant data on children. ConclusionSupport exists for using the SCAT within the acute phase of injury. Maximal utility occurs within the first 72 hours and then diminishes up to 7 days after injury. The SCAT has limited utility as a return to play tool beyond 7 days. Empirical data are limited in pre-adolescents, women, sport type, geographical and culturally diverse populations and para athletes. PROSPERO registration numberCRD42020154787.

AB In recent years, with the continued progress of science and technology, as an aided tool for physical training, the computer plays a more and more important role in continuously penetrating the high-tech achievements in the sports. The computer simulation technology has been a breakthrough in the training, which has caused the attention of the majority of sports coaches and athletes. According to the analysis of each subject of the sports training, we find that the computer simulation technology has not fully obtained the popularization and application in many aspects of the sports, which is related to the development levels of the computer simulation technology. The simulation system designed in some directions is not practical, and some are still in the blank. Therefore the application of the simulation system in the sports training has a long way to go.

SO JOURNAL OF GAMBLING ISSUES
AB Given significant technological advances, the U.S. Supreme Court ruling in 2018 permitting U.S. states to offer and regulate sports wagering, and multiple international governments already regulating and licensing sports wagering operators, sports wagering will likely continue to grow exponentially. This expanding landscape of sports wagering may pose public health problems. This literature review provides a description of our current knowledge of sports gambling behaviour among adults, adolescents, and athletes, including prevalence rates and factors associated with problem gambling sports bettors. We highlight new issues that are surfacing, particularly the interaction between online betting, sports viewing, live betting, mobile technology, and sports fantasy gambling. We also address future research directions, including the need for longitudinal studies to clarify factors that contribute to the onset and maintenance of sports-related problem gambling, to examine the impact of major league sports leagues and professional teams that partner with gambling operators and casinos on gambling behaviour, and the need to assess public policy and treatment approaches.

AB It is important to encourage people to play sports and physical activities to keep their own health and well-being. However, not many people can keep playing sports regularly. In addition, people in today tend to become physically inactive. Thus, a novel way to motivate people to become physically active, by playing sports, is desired. Augmented sports are novel sports that integrates concepts of computer games into existing physical sports. Physical sports are played in our physical, real world. Thus, physical law limits the methods. On the other hand, such methods for computer games are limitless. Augmented sports are novel sports that integrates various methods to fill or reduce the unwanted gap between humans, to make sports enjoyable regardless of their physical skill or conditions. It will contribute every sports player to feel fun and enjoyment more, that should also lead to motivate people to play sports more. In this paper, detail concept of augmented sports is described. Then, we developed an augmented dodgeball, a proof-of-concept of augmented sports. The detail of the system is also described.

AB The sports facilities are characterized by special energy needs different from any other user and they are characterized by high heat and electricity loads. For this reason, the aim of this work has been to propose a tool to provide a preliminary estimation of the power and energy required by the sports centres. In addition, the possibility to make the building self-energy sufficient has been considered, thanks to the exploitation of renewable energy sources (RES). The overall work has been performed following three steps: energy needs analysis; local RES availability analysis; energy balance of Sport Centres. Considering that each sport facility is characterized by different energy needs depending on the sport typology itself, the analysis started from the features established by the CONI (National Italian Olympic Committee) standardization.
   For calculations a program in LabVIEW has been developed to evaluate the energy requirements of the sports centre considering as inputs the sport halls, the playgrounds and the supporting rooms, the level of the sport activity (e.g. agonistic) and the climatic conditions of the area where the facilities are located.
   The locally available RES are evaluated in order to decide which one can be exploited to feed the Sport Centre. The proposed solution for the energy production refers to a combination of different and innovative technologies which involve, in particular, hydrogen technologies. The energy and costs analysis has been finally carried out for an application case in Dubai. (C) 2008 International Association for Hydrogen Energy. Published by Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

AB The technology of computer aided engineering is used in this study, firstly the material properties of the sole are defined,then the finite element models of the sports sole are built by computer numerical simulation technology, and the law of stress distribution and displacement distribution is acquired by implementing the static analysis. Secondly according to the simulation result and further analyzing, the feasibility of shoes sole structure could be judged and optimization of structural parameters of shoes sole structure could be proposed. The improved shoes sole may have a certain deformation to decrease the strains on foot when it suffered the external force, and the whole weight of it may be controlled in a certain range. So the shoes become lighter and more comfortable. Shoes sole mould would not be developed until we satisfy with the result of the simulation. It was indicated that the application of CAE technology was very significant to reduce product development cost, shorten development cycle and raise product competitive.

TI Imaging in Sports Medicine An Overview
SO SPORTS MEDICINE AND ARTHROSCOPY REVIEW
AB Increasing sports participation, and the inevitable sports injury, is a significant contributor to total healthcare expenditure in the United States. With sports-related injury ever increasing, and technology rapidly expanding in the areas of diagnosis and treatment of musculoskeletal trauma, a continual revisiting of the latest in technology is critical for the sports physician. Advances particularly in the areas of magnetic resonance imaging, diagnostic office ultrasound, and 3-dimensional reconstruction computed tomography, offer the clinician a myriad of diagnostic options in patient evaluation. Care must be exercised, however, as one pursues additional radiographic data in the patient care arena. The information must be interpreted with a firm foundation and understanding of not only the patient history and physical examination, but also the availability, indications, contraindications, sensitivity, specificity, and even the cost implications of the great spectrum of diagnostic options.

AB Information communication technologies, especially video technologies, are associated with sports today. The main advantages of those technologies are objectivity and accuracy of information, visualization power, image comparison and blending features and the feedback expected to enhance motor performance [1].
   The authors provided the practical tennis class with movie instructions on the web in National Institute of Fitness and Sports in Kanoya (NIFS). The aim of this class was to develop the "diagnosis skills" in sports. The purpose of this study was to present the details of this class and to clarify the effectiveness for developing the "diagnosis skills".
   We provide the students' own movies through the e-learning system and they could observe their movies on the web. Those movies contained each student's techniques of tennis and the game by each other students. Teaching assistant of this class edited those movies. It took almost two days to edit the movies to each student's scene and upload to e-learning system. The movies were recorded at the beginning, the middle and the end of term. Students could compare the change of their techniques with those movies.
   The papers from the students in each term was analysed and evaluated by the authors. The theme of the papers was to diagnose their own techniques and tactics from their own movies. Students described their impressions about this class in the papers as follows: "I definitely felt that I needed to master correct movement to hit good strokes", "Experienced players showed accurate movement in each stroke". The sports class with movie instructions and the papers to describe students' own techniques and tactics had some effects to develop the diagnosis skill for students in tennis. The importance to describe the movement was insisted that the first step to understand the movement rationally was to describe the movement by morphology [2].
   It was quite important not only observing their own movies but also describing their own movement or their own techniques. It was also suggested that the feedback for their viewpoints in the observations might lead to develop the "diagnosis skills" more effectively. Lieberman and Franks [3] suggested this point of view as follows: Individuals sometimes cannot regulate the video feedback they receive. And the information might exceed the athletes' processing ability. Therefore, the intervention of a coach is required particularly with inexperienced or young athlete.
   Most of the students in this class were inexperienced in tennis at the beginning of term. For those students, it might be effective to suggest and feedback the point of view from professor in each technique or in the match.

TI Application of traditional Chinese therapy in sports medicine
SO SPORTS MEDICINE AND HEALTH SCIENCE
AB Chinese herbs have been used as dietary supplements to improve exercise performance. However, evidence-based studies for the use of Chinese herbs in sports remain scarce. Traditional Chinese therapy (TCT), a form of traditional Chinese non-pharmacological intervention, has remained in use for thousands of years in sports medicine. TCT is beneficial for sports injuries and in enhancing skill development, and is becoming increasingly popular among athletes, fitness enthusiasts, and individuals who regularly exercise. The therapeutic effects of TCT have been demonstrated by clinical and experimental studies, but using these modalities still is associate with potentially adverse effects. Further well-designed studies are necessary to confirm the efficacy of TCT in sports medicine. This review aims to summarize the application of TCT, discuss the issues surrounding TCT clinical research, and provide suggestions for applying traditional Chinese methods in the field of sports medicine.

SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI), augmented (AR) and virtual reality (VR), and the associated evolving social behavior could likely catalyze a remarkable transformation in the consumption of top-tier sports. Nonetheless, existing research efforts have neglected to explore whether and how the sports management practice might need to adapt their most valuable asset, that is, the media product, to cater to future consumer needs effectively. As such, in this study, we add to the still-emerging literature by synthesizing experts' opinions to project the future of the top-tier sports media product. Based on the assessment of 71 industry experts, our results indicate how we consume top-tier sports will significantly transform by 2030. Moreover, our research extends beyond sport-specific features, elucidating the imperative for content customization and personalization and the capacity for consumers to enhance the product, thereby creating an increasingly immersive experience. These findings bear great relevance to the sports industry and across diverse sectors.

SO FRONTIERS IN SPORTS AND ACTIVE LIVING
AB Introduction There has been growth in research in the sport of curling over the past few decades. The need for a scoping review is warranted. This study's purpose was to identify and synthesize research evidence regarding quantitative variables for a series of components within the sport of curling.Methods A scoping review of studies published and established within four databases was performed. One independent reviewer selected studies based on a systematic procedure. Inclusion criteria for studies were: (1) interventions that focused on the sport of curling; (2) quantitative in nature; (3) written in English; and (4) published within a peer-reviewed journal, a conference presentation, or a published thesis.Results Searching identified 8,467 articles and 94 met the inclusion criteria. Data were organized and synthesized based on the devised research variables from the sport of curling: The curl mechanism of the curling stone; the impact of sweeping on stone trajectory; curling delivery mechanics; wheelchair curling; technology analysis; strategy and tactics; psychological factors; injury occurrences; facility and arena infrastructure; and assessment of curling training and ability. The findings confirm the strong knowledge base that exists across game variables and unveil controversy between the underlying physics that produces curl, as well as the mechanisms of sweeping responsible for manipulating the stone trajectory.Conclusions Knowledge derived from this review can assist researchers, coaches, and curlers in addressing the specific variables of the sport that influence stone trajectory and game results. Such awareness will expose gaps in the current understanding and foster new research endeavors to further the knowledge of the sport.

TI Using Artificial Intelligence-Enhanced Sensing and Wearable Technology
   in Sports Medicine and Performance Optimisation
SO SENSORS
AB Wearable technologies are small electronic and mobile devices with wireless communication capabilities that can be worn on the body as a part of devices, accessories or clothes. Sensors incorporated within wearable devices enable the collection of a broad spectrum of data that can be processed and analysed by artificial intelligence (AI) systems. In this narrative review, we performed a literature search of the MEDLINE, Embase and Scopus databases. We included any original studies that used sensors to collect data for a sporting event and subsequently used an AI-based system to process the data with diagnostic, treatment or monitoring intents. The included studies show the use of AI in various sports including basketball, baseball and motor racing to improve athletic performance. We classified the studies according to the stage of an event, including pre-event training to guide performance and predict the possibility of injuries; during events to optimise performance and inform strategies; and in diagnosing injuries after an event. Based on the included studies, AI techniques to process data from sensors can detect patterns in physiological variables as well as positional and kinematic data to inform how athletes can improve their performance. Although AI has promising applications in sports medicine, there are several challenges that can hinder their adoption. We have also identified avenues for future work that can provide solutions to overcome these challenges.

TI Sport and prosumption
SO JOURNAL OF CONSUMER CULTURE
AB This article engages and extends understanding of the interrelated concepts of prosumption, the prosumer, prosumer capitalism, and McDonaldization in relation to the highly commodified and spectacularized world of professional sport. Developing an understanding of modern sport forms as having always exhibited prosumptive dimensions, the discussion focuses on the contemporary sporting context. The analysis highlights the increasingly intertextual and interactive nature of sport prosumption, as realized through Web 2.0 technologies, such as Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, blogs, and website comment pages, all of which provide a means of contributing toward (and thereby co-producing) the prosumer sport spectacle. Within this explication of sporting prosumption, we focus on empirical forms occupying the center of the prosumption continuum: those expressions wherein the productive and consumptive aspects of prosumption are more or less evenly balanced. In doing so, we examine sport spectatorship as a form of material prosumption - the digital-based prosumption implicit within socialmediasport and the enmeshed digital and material prosumption constitutive of eSport. Our aim is to critically explicate the prosumptive dimensions of contemporary sport culture and, in conclusion, to contribute to the wider dialogue regarding the nature and implications of prosumer capitalism.

SO STAPS-SCIENCES ET TECHNIQUES DES ACTIVITES PHYSIQUES ET SPORTIVES
AB The contemporary issues surrounding << sport-sant & eacute;>> (health through sports) are attracting the attention of a wide range of players. To position themselves in this market as << providers of physical and sports activities,>> the world of associative sport is devoting its efforts to setting up a range of tools or instruments of public action. The aim here is to examine how a multi-sport federation creates, develops, and organizes its own instrumental technology. The aim for the federal network is to play a full part in the dissemination and regional regulation of the fight against sedentary lifestyles and physical inactivity, notably through the prescription system introduced by the law modernizing our healthcare system. Is this technology a prereq-uisite for professional legitimacy? Does it encourage the federal network to take an interest in << sport-sant & eacute;>> issues, and does it establish and/or strengthen a partnership dynamic with other players, particularly in the health sector?

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL RESEARCH AND ALLIED SCIENCES
AB The current study has been conducted in order to determine the relationship between some perceived aspects of ICT (Information and Communication Technology) with sport community of Khuzestan province. This study is descriptive in type and its method is correlation. So, 265 trainers from sport community of Khuzestan province who were active and qualified were selected in a random sampling method and filled out the questionnaires such as Teo perceived ease of use (2007), Teo perceived usefulness (2007), Teo attitude of using ICT (2007), Lee (2003) and Park (2004) applicability and experiences, and Fagon actual use of ICT (2004). The gathered information was studied by using multivariate regression analysis and Pierson correlation coefficient. The results showed that, some of effective factors on technology extension and acceptance can predict the actual use of technology in training of sport trainers in Khuzestan province (P <= 0.05). Also, the results showed that, there is a significant relationship between the variables, perceived ease of use, perceived usefulness, applied technology, attitude of using technology and experiences with actual use of technology in sport community training of Khuzestan province. Eventually, by considering this point that applied technology and attitude toward technology have the highest share in predicting the actual use of technology among the study variables, it is recommended that significantly consider these two issues.

AB Research programs aimed at reducing the injury potential for young athletes are based on the quality of the data available for analysis. In developing a protocol for studying risk patterns for sports, the first priority is to have a thorough knowledge of the baseline injury pattern. Whatever safety interventions are designed and implemented, there must be a mechanism for evaluating the intervention and its impact on existing injury pattern. The quality of the available data and its utility in decision-making is based on the breadth and depth of the data collection process. Today's technology has made available to the researcher a new cadre of approaches to routine injury data collection. This paper discusses some of the important procedural areas that must be addressed in the design of an injury data collection system. It examines administrative issues, data collection and management approaches, and data analysis models.

TI Technological Breakthroughs in Sport: Current Practice and Future
   Potential of Artificial Intelligence, Virtual Reality, Augmented
   Reality, and Modern Data Visualization in Performance Analysis
SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB We are currently witnessing an unprecedented era of digital transformation in sports, driven by the revolutions in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Virtual Reality (VR), Augmented Reality (AR), and Data Visualization (DV). These technologies hold the promise of redefining sports performance analysis, automating data collection, creating immersive training environments, and enhancing decision-making processes. Traditionally, performance analysis in sports relied on manual data collection, subjective observations, and standard statistical models. These methods, while effective, had limitations in terms of time and subjectivity. However, recent advances in technology have ushered in a new era of objective and real-time performance analysis. AI has revolutionized sports analysis by streamlining data collection, processing vast datasets, and automating information synthesis. VR introduces highly realistic training environments, allowing athletes to train and refine their skills in controlled settings. AR overlays digital information onto the real sports environment, providing real-time feedback and facilitating tactical planning. DV techniques convert complex data into visual representations, improving the understanding of performance metrics. In this paper, we explore the potential of these emerging technologies to transform sports performance analysis, offering valuable resources to coaches and athletes. We aim to enhance athletes' performance, optimize training strategies, and inform decision-making processes. Additionally, we identify challenges and propose solutions for integrating these technologies into current sports analysis practices. This narrative review provides a comprehensive analysis of the historical context and evolution of performance analysis in sports science, highlighting current methods' merits and limitations. It delves into the transformative potential of AI, VR, AR, and DV, offering insights into how these tools can be integrated into a theoretical model.

SO ECONOMIES
AB Blockchain has received a lot of attention in financial technology, as it combines many computer technologies, including data storage, point-to-point transmission, and consensus mechanisms, as it is considered a decentralized technology for managing transactions and data that has been developed. The study aimed to demonstrate the impact of the use of blockchain technology on the financial performance of investment projects developed by the Ministry of Sports. We used the descriptive approach (survey study method) as an appropriate method to achieve the objectives of the study due to the suitability of its procedures. The participants in the study included some leaders of the Ministry of Sports and experts in the field of sports investment, as well as some leaders working in the directorates of youth and sports, and some members of the board of directors of the Olympic Committee, sports federations, sports clubs, and youth centers. The study sample was selected in a deliberate way based on the categories of the study population. There were 300 participants in the study, and the researchers used two questionnaires as tools to collect the data. The results revealed a lack of the use of blockchain technology at the Ministry of Sports and a low level of financial performance at the Ministry of Sports. With a correlation between the level of financial performance and the use of blockchain technology, the level of the financial performance of the investment projects developed by the Ministry of Sports could be predicted based on the use of blockchain technology. Finally, the study also provides insight into political implications, limitations, and future directions.

TI Accelerometry-Based External Load Indicators in Sport: Too Many Options,
   Same Practical Outcome?
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB With the development of new microsensor technology to assess load in sports, some indicators of external load through accelerometry-based data have been created by sport technology companies. Thus, the study aim was to analyze the agreement between different accelerometry-based external load indicators (ABELIs) available in sport science. A U-16 male soccer team was assessed during three official matches, divided by periods, to obtain 3-D accelerometry data (x, y and z axes). An average of 1,420,000 data points was analyzed per axis per player. The ABELIs were calculated using this information, and the agreement between them was explored. The following ABELIs were considered after a literature review: AcelT, Player Load(RT), PlayerLoad(TM), Impulse Load, Player Load(RE) and Total Load. In order to compare ABELIs, two analyses were performed using: (1) absolute data; and (2) normalized and centered data (Z-scores). In absolute and centered data, very large to nearly perfect correlations (1st period: r > 0.803, p > 0.01; 2nd period: r > 0.919; p > 0.01) were found. Instead, very large differences were found in absolute values (bias = -579,226.6 to 285,931.1; t = -224.66 to 213.91, p < 0.01), and no differences in scaled and centered values (bias = 0; t = 1; p = 1). In conclusion, considering the different output (magnitude and units) among ABELIs, the standardization of a universal index to calculate accelerometer load is needed in order to make possible between-study comparison.

TI Media, digital technology and learning in sport: a critical response to
   Hodkinson, Biesta and James
SO PHYSICAL EDUCATION AND SPORT PEDAGOGY
AB Background: In their 2008 paper, Hodkinson, Biesta and James draw on the sociological theories of Pierre Bourdieu to construct what they claim is a holistic' theoretical framework for understanding learning. While not an attempt to dissolve the long-standing opposition between cognitive' and situated' theories, the authors claim that thinking about learning and learners in cultural' terms via Bourdieu's theories allows us theoretically to integrate individuals and learning contexts. The result, they claim, is a scalable' theory of learning that overcomes the dualisms - such as structure/agency and individual/society - that dog learning theory. We welcome both Hodkinson et al.'s ideas and overall goal. However, we were struck by the absence of any mention of communications media or digital technology in their theoretical framework. Does this mean that media and digital technology can straightforwardly be mapped onto Hodkinson et al.'s theory? Or is this a serious oversight?Purpose: Given the large amount of recent theorising about the transformative educational potential of media and digital technology - admittedly much of it speculative and hyperbolic - there appear to be some grounds for troubling some of Hodkinson et al.'s ideas by prioritising the effects of media and digital technology on learning.Methods: We used two examples of learning in sports, one historical and the other contemporary, to consider the theoretical implications of media and digital technology's role in sports learning. The first explores the ways professional footballers learned to produce displays of emotion during the 1950s and 1960s. Our second example presents data from semi-structured interviews with downhill longboard skateboarders and focuses on how these young people use and think about digital technology as they learn their sport.Findings: While not rejecting Hodkinson et al.'s preference for Bourdieu's sociological theories, we draw on other theories that do not see the relationship between the individual' and society' as their conceptual starting point. To this end, we touch on Actor Network Theory (ANT), connectivism' and the theoretical work of Deleuze and Guattari in order to at least question whether Bourdieu's ideas are sufficiently flexible or dynamic to account for learning in media- and technology-saturated environments. Most obviously, rather than the individual/society dualism which Hodkinson et al. simultaneously question but also rely on, are there advantages in using flatter' metaphors such as the network' to understand learning?Conclusions: We agree with Hodkinson et al.'s point that theories are tools for thinking with and that their metaphorical power can and should be harnessed to improve the way we teach. It is for this reason that we question Hodkinson et al.'s claim to offer a holistic' theory of learning. All theories, like metaphors, have real-world limitations and this is why we should always be suspicious of theories that claim to be able to see' the world from all angles and, perhaps more fundamentally, to dissolve the dualisms that they are built on. Theories are always a partial view from somewhere and just as they help us to see some things, they do so by demanding that we not see others.

TI Home-Based Measurements of Nocturnal Cardiac Parasympathetic Activity in
   Athletes during Return to Sport after Sport-Related Concussion
SO SENSORS
AB Sport-related concussions (SRC) are characterized by impaired autonomic control. Heart rate variability (HRV) offers easily obtainable diagnostic approaches to SRC-associated dysautonomia, but studies investigating HRV during sleep, a crucial time for post-traumatic cerebral regeneration, are relatively sparse. The aim of this study was to assess nocturnal HRV in athletes during their return to sports (RTS) after SRC in their home environment using wireless wrist sensors (E4, Empatica, Milan, Italy) and to explore possible relations with clinical concussion-associated sleep symptoms. Eighteen SRC athletes wore a wrist sensor obtaining photoplethysmographic data at night during RTS as well as one night after full clinical recovery post RTS (>3 weeks). Nocturnal heart rate and parasympathetic activity of HRV (RMSSD) were calculated and compared using the Mann-Whitney U Test to values of eighteen; matched by sex, age, sport, and expertise, control athletes underwent the identical protocol. During RTS, nocturnal RMSSD of SRC athletes (Mdn = 77.74 ms) showed a trend compared to controls (Mdn = 95.68 ms, p = 0.021, r = -0.382, p adjusted using false discovery rate = 0.126) and positively correlated to "drowsiness" (r = 0.523, p = 0.023, p adjusted = 0.046). Post RTS, no differences in RMSSD between groups were detected. The presented findings in nocturnal cardiac parasympathetic activity during nights of RTS in SRC athletes might be a result of concussion, although its relation to recovery still needs to be elucidated. Utilization of wireless sensors and wearable technologies in home-based settings offer a possibility to obtain helpful objective data in the management of SRC.

SO PLACE BRANDING AND PUBLIC DIPLOMACY
AB The purpose of this article is to explore and discuss the role of the growing sport-tech ecosystem and the branding of Israel as a start-up nation in the country's sports diplomacy. When analysing Israel's deteriorating image, scholars and practitioners recommended to focus the country's branding and diplomatic efforts on micro-marketing and in creating bypassing messages to the Israeli-Arab dispute. While other countries manage to use sports for such purposes, international politics often limited Israel's possibilities. Being the number one country in the world in start-ups per capita, and having a growing sport-tech ecosystem used by some of the biggest international sport-related organizations, embody new opportunities especially in the context of "sport-tech diplomacy". The article is significant as it contributes to existing literature on the branding of Israel as a "start-up nation", on Israel's sports diplomacy, and on public diplomacy and soft power through exploring the intersections of technology, innovation, sports, and diplomacy, using the term "sport-tech diplomacy".

AB With the advancement of Computer Vision (CV) classification of sports images is very popular nowadays. Deep learning techniques have become feasible to use and see what happens inside the contents of an image. As videos are the collection of continuous images, or 'frames', this technique can be also used in videos. Computer Vision tends to reduce the complexities in the human visualization system and understanding by applying convolutional neural network models to accurately recognize and classify objects from the potential and asymmetrical physical world. Classification of images is now very popular in recent years as the emergence of computer vision technology but it is quite challenging. In this paper, we proposed a VGG16 transfer learning model to classify eighteen categories of various sports and we have created our sports dataset which contains 9000 images. Our proposed model has shown a promising result which is 93%.

   technology and SVM prediction
SO PREVENTIVE MEDICINE
AB In the field of sports, coaches have mainly relied on observing the performance of athletes on the spot to formulate suitable training plans for athletes, which has extremely high requirements for the professionalism of coaches. Based on the above requirements, this paper designs a sports action recognition system for sports enthusiasts based on the SVM algorithm optimization model, and for the purpose of verifying the applicability of the system to different sports fields, experiments are carried out on basketball actions and race walking actions. The system uses wearable sensors to capture the motion data of the user, and then analyzes and identifies the user's actions through the SVM algorithm optimization model. By standardizing the user's sports combination training under the system algorithm, the user can improve their training efficiency and reduce the risk of injury. To establish the human body motion model, this paper divides the human skeleton model into five motion branches. The rotation freedom constraints and joint rotation angle range limits are added to the model to ensure the accuracy of the motion analysis. Combining the forward kinematics of the robot and the homogeneous coordinate transformation, the human body joint rotation motion model and the human bone position and posture model are established. In the end, the user can standardize the sports combination training under the system algorithm. In this paper, through the research of wearable sensor technology and sports combined training action recognition, and apply it to practical life, it aims to promote its development and application.

AB The popularity of sports activities boosts the ever-increasing demands for improving sports equipment to meet various needs. There are two major methods of making advanced sports equipment - the application of advanced design and use of advanced materials. Light metals, aluminum, titanium and magnesium have been widely adopted in many sports activities because of their low density. However, these bulk light materials cannot possess all the combined desired attributes, especially their surface attributes, such as mechanical properties, wear resistance, corrosion resistance and aesthetic appearance. Therefore, surface engineering technologies have been used to satisfy the specific needs of advanced sports equipment. In this chapter, the application of surface engineered light alloys, aluminum, titanium and magnesium alloys, in various sports activities are introduced and discussed.

SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The context of the COVID-19 pandemic has caused educational institutions and sports clubs to change their management strategy. Due to the modernization of computer technology, physical education and sports (PES) teachers decided to include this technology in their teaching activity to help students and athletes to acquire PES-specific transversal skills and digital skills, and also to increase the attractiveness of the lessons. The present research aims at assessing the challenges and opportunities of technology and adopting an Agile Management style to improve the teaching, learning, and practice of PES. Therefore, a survey was conducted on PES teachers and trainers, as they have a clear perspective on the field and their views are therefore very important and relevant to our study, even if they do not have solutions for all the challenges facing them. They were asked to share their professional opinions regarding the implementation of digital methods and applications on the sportive results of performance sportsmen, athletes, and students. The survey, conducted on 144 respondents, contained mostly multiple-choice questions rated on a Likert scale and open-ended questions allowing respondents to offer solutions and express their opinion freely. This article demonstrates the positive influence of Agile Management in the choice and implementation of technology dedicated to PES.

AB Participation in leisure sports is undergoing a transformation that is guided by societal and cultural changes as well as recent developments in, and the use of, digital sports media and technologies. This paper discusses how changes in leisure sports participation can be understood using mediatization as a theoretical framework. This theoretically informed analysis of change is contextualized within Finnish climbing and trail running subcultures. The paper proposes that mediatization contributes to the diversification of the sporting landscape, enables fluidity in sports communities, and strengthens commercialization of leisure sports. Additionally, the paper outlines how the dynamics of de- and reinstitutionalization of leisure sports are connected to the rise of digital media and communication.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPORT COMMUNICATION
AB This study addresses a topic neglected by the sport management literature: the impact of anticorruption effects of information and communication technology (ICT) in sport organizations on the role of organizational health mediation and organizational transparency. This study analyses this topic by presenting and testing a comprehensive theoretical model. This quantitative, descriptive survey uses structural equation modeling methodology. Data collection was carried out by employees (N = 384) working at the Iranian Ministry of Sport and Youth. The results of the study were processed using LISREL 8.80 software in the model and hypothesis testing, and the study found support for the theoretical model. The results show that (a) ICT is an effective tool for reducing administrative corruption of officials, and (b) in terms of both organizational health (variance accounted for = 0.40) and organizational transparency (variance accounted for = 0.39), ICT has a mediating role in reducing administrative corruption in sport organizations. This study fills a gap in the literature by addressing both personal and managerial perspectives, thus allowing directors of sport organizations to consider ICT a useful and practical management tool for reducing corruption among officials in sport organizations, as an adjunct to traditional methods such as administrative reform and law enforcement.

TI Techniques to derive and clean acceleration and deceleration data of
   athlete tracking technologies in team sports: A scoping review
SO JOURNAL OF SPORTS SCIENCES
AB The application of acceleration and deceleration data as a measure of an athlete's physical performance is common practice in team sports. Acceleration and deceleration are monitored with athlete tracking technologies during training and games to quantify training load, prevent injury and enhance performance. However, inconsistencies exist throughout the literature in the reported methodological procedures used to quantify acceleration and deceleration. The object of this review was to systematically map and provide a summary of the methodological procedures being used on acceleration and deceleration data obtained from athlete tracking technologies in team sports and describe the applications of the data. Systematic searches of multiple databases were undertaken. To be included, studies must have investigated full body acceleration and/or deceleration data of athlete tracking technologies. The search identified 276 eligible studies. Most studies (60%) did not provide information on how the data was derived and what sequence of steps were taken to clean the data. Acceleration and deceleration data were commonly applied to quantify and describe movement demands using effort metrics. This scoping review identified research gaps in the methodological procedures and deriving and cleaning techniques that warrant future research focussing on their effect on acceleration and deceleration data.

AB Sports consumption, as a product of the development of social productive forces to a certain stage, is a personal consumption behavior aiming to pursue fitness and entertainment after satisfying the existence consumption. Owing to the constant and rapid development of China's economy and the enlarged size of higher education enrollment, in the context of universal concern of health, development of sports industry seems increasingly important. Based on the analyses of sports industry structure, tips on the development of sports consumption are offered. Sports consumption can be divided into tangible consumption and intangible labor service consumption. With the improvement of living standards and enhanced awareness of national fitness, it is gradually becoming an important aspect of residential consumption.
   If we take as an assumption that a healthy, positive and wholesome lifestyle is the goal of individuals in society, then clearly sport should be able to contribute to achieving that goal. That implies both the consumption of and participation in sporting activities. This paper will also investigate impacts of its development constraints, lead people to consume rationally, and raise the level of sports consumption.

TI Introducing mobile learning in sport management education: Exploring
   gender differences in Pinterest usage
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART P-JOURNAL OF
   SPORTS ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
AB We live in an increasingly interconnected world thanks to the advance of digitalization. Digital tools such as mobile devices or social media platforms have transformed the way in which people and organizations relate to each other. Higher education and sports are two of the areas of society where we have seen more changes caused by the rise of digitalization. In education, digital tools have revolutionized the way in which classes are taught, moving classrooms toward hybrid or online models. In the case of sport, digital tools such as social media are essential for sport managers when interacting with the sport ecosystem. Despite the advances that digital technology is bringing about in society, studies exploring the potential of social media and digital tools in sport management classrooms are scarce. This work explores the possibilities that a little-studied social media platform, such as Pinterest, offers when introduced in the classroom through mobile-based learning and active learning methodologies. In addition, and in a pioneering way in the case of Pinterest, it explores the possible differences depending on the gender of the students. A total of 72 students of the "Sports Equipment and Facilities" course at a Spanish university participated in this study. After finishing the educational intervention with Pinterest, students completed a questionnaire to share their perceptions. Subsequently, t-tests for independent samples were performed through the statistical package SPSS 27.0. The results obtained highlight that all students, regardless of gender, had a positive perception of Pinterest in the teaching-learning process. In addition, women scored higher on all items, with significant differences in four areas. In view of these results, it is concluded that the use of Pinterest through mobile learning is positive in the university context. Furthermore, there is a gender variable influence in the students' perceptions regarding Pinterest.

TI VALUE ORIENTATION AS BASIS FOR STUDENTS' SPORTS CULTURE FORMATION IN
   PHYSICAL CULTURE AND SPORTS EDUCATION
SO TOMSK STATE UNIVERSITY JOURNAL
AB The article considers the results of the survey of students of the Faculty of Physical Culture on attitudes to life and sports values, as well as to the principles of fair play in sport. It shows the significance of the value orientations of students in the formation of their sports culture in the process of physical culture and sports education. Sports culture as a social phenomenon of the company is a part of culture, a system-forming factor of which is the values of sport and personal attitude to physical culture and sports activities. Sports culture of the person is formed in the process of person's internalization of the cultural and educational potential, values and technologies of sports, as well as in the result of accumulation of experience of physical culture and sports activities and finding personal sense in it. The problem of forming attitudes, value orientations as the basis of sports, cultural identity, is particularly relevant for higher educational institutions that prepare specialists for work in the field of education, including physical fitness and sports. In the professional-pedagogical activity the trainer needs to follow the principles of humanism and control of complex moral qualities: honesty, insistence, optimism, etc., for moral upbringing should be based not only on the verbal form of influence, but also, and first of all, on personal example. The majority of students of the Faculty of Physical Culture believe in such values as tolerance, positive attitude towards the opponent, beauty of actions and acts, culture of behaviour, care and attention to others. Approval of moral-ethical norms and principles in the modern sport is one of the most urgent problems of this cultural phenomenon. This is due to the increasing contradiction between, on the one hand, the orientation of young sportsmen and participants of the Olympic movement on pragmatic values, and, on the other, the ideals and principles, which the Olympic philosophy proclaims. As a result, the study revealed a positive attitude of students of the Faculty of Physical Culture to the most vital physical culture and sports values. At the same time, in case of general positive attitude of students to the principles of fair play in sport, in reality the students-sportsmen can sometimes allow breaking them and do not worry about it. Therefore, in the process of professional-pedagogical training of students of the Faculty of Physical Culture it is necessary to carry out purposeful Olympic education, based on the ideas and principles of Olympism.

SO WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS & MOBILE COMPUTING
AB Multiagent technology, as a conceptual model commonly used in intelligent systems, has now had a lot of related research, and it is also widely used in sports training simulation systems. This paper mainly studies the development of the sports training simulation system based on agent technology. This paper proposes the motion perception system of multiagent technology in sports training. In the research, this paper introduces the related concepts and methods of agent in detail. In order to better simulate the changes of human joints during exercise with the system, this article uses a variety of comparison methods. Among them, the experiment of the imaging analysis module is carried out through the simulation of the simulation system. The experimental results show that the role of multiagent in the simulation system is huge. In linear motion, the accuracy of joint extraction has reached more than 95%. The extraction of joints in the curve movement reached more than 80%, indicating that it can not only complete the relevant processing adaptively but also predict and correct the exercise process of the trainer. Therefore, in the research of sports training simulation system, more attention should be paid to the research of curve motion.

TI GENETICS, BIOETHICS AND SPORT
SO SPORT ETHICS AND PHILOSOPHY
AB This paper considers the relevance of human genetics as a case study through which links between bioethics and sport ethics have developed. Initially, it discusses the science of gene-doping and the ethics of policy-making in relation to future technologies, suggesting that the gene-doping example can elucidate concerns about the ethics of sport and human enhancement more generally. Subsequently, the conceptual overlap between sport and bioethics is explored in the context of discussions about doping. From here, the paper investigates the ethics of gene-doping, arguing that a straightforward mapping of medical ethics onto sport ethics is not justified. In conclusion, it argues that gene-doping is consistent with a broader ethics of enhancement within elite sports. Moreover, the increased legitimacy of lifestyle medicine in society is likely to reduce the relevance of an anti-doping programme that is concerned with protecting the integrity of an alleged natural athlete.

TI Sports Injuries: Diagnosis, Prevention, Stem Cell Therapy, and Medical
   Sport Strategy
SO TISSUE ENGINEERING AND REGENERATIVE MEDICINE
SE Advances in Experimental Medicine and Biology
AB Sports injuries diagnosis, prevention, and treatment are the most important issues of sports medicine. Fortunately, sports injuries are often treated effectively, and people with damage recover and return to the sport in a satisfactory condition. Meanwhile, many sports injuries and complications can be prevented. In general, sports injuries include acute or chronic injuries. Given increasing in popularity, sports medicine doctors use stem cells to treat a wide variety of sports injuries, including damage to tendons, ligaments, muscles, and cartilage. Stem cell therapy to an injured area could be done through direct surgical application, stem-cell-bearing sutures, and injection. Stem cell therapy holds potential for repair and functional plasticity following sports injuries compared to traditional methods; however, the mechanism of stem cell therapy for sports injuries remains largely unknown. Medical imaging technologies provide the hope to ample the knowledge concerning basic stem cell biology in real time when transplanted into sport-induced damaged organs. Using stem cell treatment might restore continuity and regeneration and promote growth back the organ targets. Besides, using a noninvasive medical imaging method would have the long-time monitoring advantage to the stem cells transplanting individual. The multimodality imaging technique allows for studying acute pathological events following sports injuries; therefore, the use of imaging techniques in medicine permits the straight examination of dynamic regenerative events of specific stem cells following a sports injury in people.

TI The utility of markerless motion capture for performance analysis in
   racket sports
SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART P-JOURNAL OF
   SPORTS ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Recent technological advancements have allowed movements to be tracked ecologically via markerless motion capture (mocap). However, occlusions remain a major concern pertaining to markerless mocap. Within racket sports where the number of players involved are low and occlusions are minimal, there exists a unique opportunity to delve into and provide an overview on the utilisation of markerless mocap technology. Twenty studies were included after a systematic search. Several methods were applied to obtain 2D positional data. Most studies adopted some form of background subtraction or thresholding method (n = 12), the remaining relied on pose estimation algorithms (PEA; n = 3), Hawk-Eye (n = 2) and object recognition (n = 1). Conversely, only the visual hull method was found to obtain 3D joint kinematics (n = 2). Markerless mocap are conventionally used to extract joint kinematics, however, study results revealed that the predominant use of markerless mocap was to capture the movement of a player's location on court, this finding was unexpected. Low sampling frequencies of input videos and unsuitability of model detection used in the included studies could have limited the ability for markerless mocap to accurately track movements in racket sports. While current evidence suggests that the use of PEA in racket sports to extract 3D kinematics is limited, perhaps a slightly different approach gearing towards performance analysis, specifically stroke classification with the amalgamation of player location data and joint kinematics may be worth exploring further.

SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART P-JOURNAL OF
   SPORTS ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
AB Sport is an industry that may benefit from the opportunities offered by additive manufacturing (AM), and the media has portrayed increasing adoption of the technology in sports products. This systematic review aimed to consolidate and interpret the available empirical evidence concerning applications of AM in sports following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis Protocols (PRISMA-P) 2015. Four databases were searched within the date range of January 1984 to May 2019, using 28 broad and specific search phrases. This search resulted in 26 articles for analysis, the first appearing in 2010. Twelve sports in total were identified across the literature, with running/walking the most popular sport with ten articles (38%) investigating AM, followed by cycling with four articles (15%) and badminton with three articles (12%). Ten articles (38%) observed improvements in performance of products developed via AM compared to conventionally manufactured products, eight articles (31%) found a similar performance, and five articles (19%) found a lower performance. From a technical perspective, powder bed fusion technologies were the most utilized with 50% of articles using either selective laser sintering (SLS) or selective laser melting (SLM), although 52% of articles did not name the 3D printer used and 36% did not name any software used to design or optimize products. 3D scanning technology was also utilized in 11 articles (42%). Results indicate that AM has been slow to permeate sports research, and while considered across a variety of potential applications, has largely resulted in singular studies with potentially limited opportunities or funding for follow-up investigations.

TI Identifying critical factors in sport consumption decision making of
   millennial sport fans: mixed-methods approach
SO EUROPEAN SPORT MANAGEMENT QUARTERLY
AB Research question: The purpose of the study was to identify consumption traits that might influence millennial sport fan behavior. Research methods: We accomplished this objective by using mixed methods (i.e. review of literature, focus group (N = 18), and survey (N = 300)). We analyzed the millennial sport fan consumption traits by calculating descriptive statistics and conducting ANOVA to compare their traits with Baby Boomers and Generation X. Results and findings: The literature review revealed the five traits of millennial fan consumption: (a) technology-driven, (b) community-driven, (c) peer pressure (FoMO), (d) emotional consumption, and (e) fan engagement. These prominent traits also emerged from focus group interviews and the survey. Generational differences among sport fans were also found. Implications: With regard to theoretical and practical implications we identified traits that influenced millennial consumption behaviors. The results of the current study suggest that segmentation research is an effective and efficient way to reach target consumer groups, an approach that can benefit sport organizations. Differences among the three generations indicate the necessity of developing specific marketing strategies to target millennial fans, for which practitioners should apply five millennial consumption traits when deploying marketing strategies.

TI Rethinking the management of drugs in sport
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPORT POLICY AND POLITICS
AB The management of drugs in sport has been dominated by the policy of anti-doping. Experience with this policy over the last 50 years or so suggests there may be more effective ways to manage the role of drugs in sport. This paper looks at the lessons that can be drawn from the anti-doping policy experiment towards developing a 'second generation' of policies to manage the use of drugs in sport. The aims of anti-doping policy are summarised as the 'elimination of doping to protect the integrity of sport', with the latter discussed as the aim of anti-doping and the former the method. The integrity of sport is discussed in terms of protecting the ideological or moral integrity of sport, and protecting the financial integrity of sport. The elimination of doping is considered in terms of the arguments surrounding the detection of drugs and the imposition of sanctions on drug users, both of which underpin much anti-doping policy. We argue that the management of drug use in sport needs to be fundamentally reconsidered in three key ways: (i) there needs to be a much clearer rationale justifying the aims, objectives and purpose of anti-doping policy; (ii) the inefficiencies of the doping and anti-doping industries need to be eliminated with the objective of creating public good; and (iii) detection and sanction technologies need to be reconceptualised to help policy-makers manage better the use of drugs in sport.

SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB Updating and complementing a previous review on eye-tracking technology and the dynamics of natural gaze behavior in sports, this short review focuses on the progress concerning researched sports tasks, applied methods of gaze data collection and analysis as well as derived gaze measures for the time interval of 2016-2022. To that end, a systematic review according to the PRISMA guidelines was conducted, searching Web of Science, PubMed Central, SPORTDiscus, and ScienceDirect for the keywords: eye tracking, gaze behavio*r, eye movement, and visual search. Thirty-one studies were identified for the review. On the one hand, a generally increased research interest and a wider area of researched sports with a particular increase in official's gaze behavior were diagnosed. On the other hand, a general lack of progress concerning sample sizes, amounts of trials, employed eye-tracking technology and gaze analysis procedures must be acknowledged. Nevertheless, first attempts to automated gaze-cue-allocations (GCA) in mobile eye-tracking studies were seen, potentially enhancing objectivity, and alleviating the burden of manual workload inherently associated with conventional gaze analyses. Reinforcing the claims of the previous review, this review concludes by describing four distinct technological approaches to automating GCA, some of which are specifically suited to tackle the validity and generalizability issues associated with the current limitations of mobile eye-tracking studies on natural gaze behavior in sports.

AB With the use of technologically constructed hypoxic environments (TCHE) in soccer as our case, we propose four check points from which to evaluate new performance-enhancing technologies in sport. These are (I) Is the technology beneficial, (II) Is it safe, (III) Can fairness be assured, and (IV) Is the technology in line with the spirit of or rationale for sport? The use of TCHE is ambiguous. On the one hand, in situations with grave inequalities between teams due to lack of acclimatization of one team, TCHE can be an efficient means to even the playing field and out of concern for athlete welfare and health. On the other hand, if used as a pure performance-enhancing means to enhance the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood independent of altitude, it belongs to a category of expert-assisted performance enhancement that may challenge athletic autonomy and the responsibility for one's own performance and, hence, the spirit of sport.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPORT POLICY AND POLITICS
AB Drawing on the Foucauldian concept of governmentality and with a discourse analytic approach, the purpose of this study was to describe and analyse how wheelchair basketball (WCB) players governed themselves in relation to the dominant discourses of sport, gender and disability. This study was based on semi-structured interviews with 12 men and 6 women with and without classified impairment. The findings illustrated how governing operates in the micro-context of WCB and how the athletes were constituted at the intersection between technologies of power and technologies of the self. On the one hand, they were categorized according to a classification system by which the athletes were organized into competitive classes based upon sport-specific tests. On the other, they were taking up and rehearsing narratives about themselves in terms of normality. Finally, the results have shown how male and female WCB athletes take up and resist predominant sport, gender and disability discourses and how they govern themselves in relation to such discourses. The results of the study also illustrate how the workings of power were differentiated within the WCB context and how the sport and gender discourses provided instructions on how to become the desired ideal.

TI WHY DISRUPTIVE SPORT COMPETITION TECHNOLOGIES ARE USED BY AMATEUR
   ATHLETES? AN ANALYSIS OF VAPORFLY SHOES WITH AN UTAUT MODEL
SO JOURNAL OF SPORT AND HEALTH RESEARCH
AB Objectives: The Vaporfly tech (VFT) for road running shoes has supposed a disruption in distance running shoes. Academic research suggests that VFT improves performance, at least, in elite and sub-elite athletes. This paper assesses empirically factors influencing the acceptance of disruptive competition technologies, focusing on the perceptions about the VFT shoes by amateur athletes.Material and methods: We analyse a survey over 252 Spanish amateur athletes (214 men and 38 women). Our research uses Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT), including ethical awareness of athletes that is measured by means of their judgement on moral equity (ME), and athlete income.Results: The proposed model explains almost half of the intention to use (IU) disruptive technologies by athletes. Adjusted structural equation model (SEM) shows that significant influential factors on IU are easiness expectation whose path coefficient (pc) is 0.467 (p<0.01), performance expectancy (pc=0.203, p<0.05), perception on ME (pc=0.298, p<0.01) and athlete's income (pc=0.123, p<0.01). Surprisingly, social influence has a weak influence on the IU. Similar results are attained with Poisson regression.Discussion: This paper applies a theoretical framework that combines findings in consumer behaviour (UTAUT model) and moral equity dimension of a multiple ethical scale to explain intention to use VFT. Of course, proposed methodology can be used to evaluate a disruptive tech within the context of any other sport.Conclusions: Findings have important implications in the sport industry. As we expected and also has shown by reviewed literature linked to sport tech, conventional UTAUT has been revealed useful theoretical framework to explain the acceptance of disruptive sport techs in the competitive arena. In addition, ethical aspects also should be considered in their development.

SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED SPORT MANAGEMENT
AB Understanding what aspects of sport consumption experiences are necessary to be innovative to gain and sustain long-term competitive advantage is a key issue in sport marketing. Presented herein is a multi-dimensional conceptualization of innovative sport consumption experiences, including six dimensions: sport performance, aesthetic environment, facility convenience, online services, brand community, and loyalty programs. Data were collected from spectators at a professional baseball game and users of a running station in Japan. Through a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM), we assessed the construct and nomological validity of the proposed scale to measure the innovative sport consumption experience. In both settings, aesthetic environment innovativeness was the dominant factor in enhancing consumer satisfaction and brand attitude. Furthermore, the effects of brand community innovativeness on consumer satisfaction, brand attitude, and behavioral intentions were positive and significant for the baseball sample, while online services innovativeness positively influenced consumer satisfaction and brand attitude in the running station setting. The proposed framework was a useful model for understanding consumers' assessments of innovative sport consumption experiences based on specific innovation points.

AB During a playoff game, the visual boards throughout a sold-out stadium displays warnings to evacuate because of a hazardous situation, such as a fire inside the venue. Suddenly, spectators are panicked, stadium workers are confused, and the evacuation team designated by the venue begins the task of getting a large crowd out safely and effectively. The power then suddenly goes out amidst the evacuation efforts. This disconcerting event might have begun with a cyber attack on the systems controlling the stadium. A cyber attacker might have gained access to remotely controllable systems, possibly causing physical harm.
   With professional sports teams and stadiums becoming more and more connected through technology for an improved spectator experience, an increased need for cybersecurity is evident. Fans are susceptible to phishing scams through mobile applications, while remotely controlled systems are vulnerable to hacking. Public wireless networks are open to man-in-the-middle attacks. Professional stadiums may also be in close proximity to one another in large cities, leading to traffic management issues as well as network isolation concerns. If shared or wireless networking resources exist among more than one entity, propagation across the network may occur, leaving multiple venues open to malicious actors. Also, with the increased reliance on technological capabilities throughout sports, the integrity of the game can be negatively impacted. The integration of cyber into such aspects of the game as player performance and data analytics can leave teams within various leagues susceptible to cyber attacks.

AB The imminent development of competition system has determined over time a shift from amateur sport, practiced by passion and for health reasons, to the promotion of its professional component. But throughout the centuries, changes have been essential. Innovation is one of the actions that have marked the development and transformation of world sports in general and Olympic Games in particular. The types of innovation found in the organization, equipment, technology during more than 100 years are: product innovation, process innovation, market innovation, organizational innovation. As regards sports at a global level, innovations in the timekeeping system in different disciplines (athletics, swimming, horse riding, skiing, biathlon, cross-country skiing, bobsleigh, luge, skeleton) have determined the ranking order to be decided by thousandths of a second, and the cases of ties among many competitors to become very rare. Research conducted in great laboratories of the world to change materials used on the competition grounds (from the athletics track, the floor and the vaulting table in gymnastics to the system of freezing the tracks of bobsleigh, luge, skeleton) has led to achievement of performances thought to be impossible one century ago. Studies have been made about the effect of modern equipment on sports performances, and research in the field has become even more important than the talent of an athlete. In this study based on bibliographical research, we are trying to demonstrate that innovation in the TV broadcasting field has provided global population access to information, having a direct contribution to promoting sports.

TI SMALL BUSINESSES DRIVING SUSTAINABLE GROWTH IN THE SPORTS INDUSTRY
   ECONOMY
SO SINGAPORE ECONOMIC REVIEW
AB Using the ARDL method, this study examines the sustainability of China's sports industry from 1980 to 2021, focusing on the impact of the number of Micro, Small, and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs). The findings show a negative correlation between the number of MSMEs and carbon emissions from sports manufacturing, with a 1% increase in MSMEs leading to a 0.26% and 0.34% reduction in emissions in the short and long term, respectively. The study also finds that increased imports of sports commodities are associated with lower CO2 emissions, highlighting the sustainability benefits of global trade. Conversely, a positive correlation between state spending on sports and CO2 emissions indicates a need for more sustainable investment strategies. Additionally, population growth is linked to higher emissions, underscoring the need for sustainable management practices. The study recommends focusing on supporting MSMEs and startups, adjusting state spending, and utilizing digital technologies to promote a more sustainable sports manufacturing sector in China.

TI Simulated Altitude Training and Sport Performance: Protocols and

SO APPLIED SCIENCES-BASEL
AB Featured Application This article explores diverse hypoxia training protocols to improve sports performance, including hypoxia high-intensity interval training (HHIIT) and incremental hypoxia training.Abstract This article explores the physiological mechanisms and effects of simulated hypoxia environment training on sports performance. Different training protocols, including hypoxia high-intensity interval training (HHIIT), incremental hypoxia training, hypoxia submaximal exercise training and combined training, and hypoxia training in the recovery and sleep states, are discussed. HHIIT combines intermittent hypoxia exposure with high-intensity interval training, and has been shown to increase the maximum oxygen intake compare to the state of normoxia, improving cardiorespiratory fitness, skeletal muscle oxygen utilization, power performance, hematological adaptations, and sports performance. Incremental hypoxia training involves the gradual decrease in oxygen concentration while maintaining exercise intensity. It has been found to improve aerobic capacity; however, fewer effects were observed in hematological variables. Hypoxia submaximal exercise training and combined training in a hypoxia environment has shown to increase VO2 and VE, and only improve hemodynamic function in combined training with hypoxia. Hypoxia during the recovery state has been associated with improvements in maximum oxygen uptake, also providing benefits to sports performance. Overall, exposure to a hypoxia environment has been demonstrated to improve cardiorespiratory endurance, power performance, and specific physiological adaptations in training and resting states. However, the optimal training protocols and their effects on different sports and athlete proficiency require further research to optimize training and enhance athletic performance in hypoxia environments.

AB This brief opinion-based editorial addresses what the authors perceive to be a fundamental issue in the application of sport science, and these issues are reflected by the question "Are you doing any sport science?" As sport science has grown within the United States, organizational sport science budgets have grown, with increasing interest in developing various sport science initiatives. While it is indeed an exciting time for sport science, the authors suggest that, too often, sport science pursuits are driven by commercially available technologies and viewed as an "add-on" instead of pursuing an integrated systematic approach to informing the training process.

AB The article addresses the sport 4.0 trend from a bibliometric perspective. This type of sport emerging in contemporary sports culture uses information and communication technologies to enhance the sporting experience for athletes, coaches, fans, and other stakeholders in the sport. The objective was to analyze the characteristics, technologies and designs with lines of innovation in sport 4.0 from the bibliographic reviews and their practical implementation. The results highlight the importance of Big Data, the Internet of Things and Artificial Intelligence applied to sport 4.0. A systematic literature review was carried out in the Scopus database, examining 585 articles published from January 2012 to June 2022. The implementation stage of a sport 4.0 event with students from the Sports Administration and Management research hotbed was based on the pedagogical strategy of formative research, an initiative that allowed applying the knowledge acquired in the classroom in a real and practical environment. It required a careful and planned process on the part of the principal investigators, who made sure to involve all relevant stakeholders, both students and teachers. The sample consisted of 24 students in the role of athletes divided into 12 teams, 12 students in the role of Staff (organizing committee) and 100 students in the role of spectators. It is concluded that this trend addresses the complexity of contemporary sports culture with a holistic and interdisciplinary approach, which leads to changes in good sports practices.

TI Web log mining techniques to optimize Apriori association rule algorithm
   in sports data information management
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB To optimize the current college sports data information management system, this study combines the Apriori association rule algorithm with web application development technology to upgrade the management system. Firstly, this study explores novel log mining techniques in genetic algorithms and web application development technology. Secondly, by integrating log mining techniques to optimize the Apriori algorithm, associations between sports data and information are discovered. Through the optimized algorithm, this study identifies key association rules of sports data information and validates the optimized system's reliability and effectiveness through experiments. The experimental results show that the running time of the traditional Apriori algorithm exponentially grows with the increase in information volume, while the optimized execution efficiency is improved by approximately 10-15%. Additionally, the average retrieval accuracy of this optimized system can reach 98.3%, although the retrieval time also increased by 23%. Therefore, the technology and algorithms proposed in this study have certain application value in the sports information management system and contribute to the optimization of data information management in this field.

TI SPORTS JOURNALISM, SUPPORTERS AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES Challenging the usual
   complicity between media and football institutions
SO DIGITAL JOURNALISM
AB Grounded on the analysis of the campaign #ForaRicardoTeixeira (Get Out Ricardo Teixeira), this article investigates how supporters have used new technologies to challenge controversial decisions of media outlets that hold sports broadcast rights in not covering or under-reporting the severity of scandals involving sports governing bodies and leaders. Adopting a combination of political economy and discursive analysis, this work explores how the interplay between media system and football industry in Brazil led to the perpetuation of a complicity relationship between the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) and Grupo Globo, broadcast rights holder of the main football events since the 1970s in Brazil. Such complicity guaranteed that many corruption allegations against Teixeira during his 23 years running CBF received little attention in the news programming of Globo. In 2011, when the company decided not to cover the ISL case (at that time a still ongoing Swiss investigation that implicated Teixeira in an extensive scheme of corruption and bribery), Brazilian supporters organised themselves to create the campaign, which for many observers was indeed one of the factors that pressed Teixeira to resign from his post in 2012. The campaign had several merits, including its effective use of decentralised media production tools. However, its main pitfall was its personalised focus on Teixeira, which prevented a broader thematisation of the structural problems of football.

TI Factors influencing consumer use of a sport-branded app: the technology
   acceptance model integrating app quality and perceived enjoyment
SO ASIA PACIFIC JOURNAL OF MARKETING AND LOGISTICS
AB Purpose The current study extends the technology acceptance model (TAM) and information system success model (ISSM) to the context of branded sport applications. Specifically, the study examined the influences of app system success dimensions and TAM determinants on branded sport app usage intention. Moreover, the current study examined the gender differences regarding the relative importance of the drivers and predictors of usage intention. Design/methodology/approach Data collection (n = 256) was conducted using convenience sampling in South Korea. The data were primarily analyzed via partial least squares structural equation modeling (PLS-SEM), multi-group analysis and importance-performance map analysis (IPMA) using SmartPLS 3.0. Findings App users who viewed branded sport apps as having a higher level of system and information quality were likely to have stronger perceptions of enjoyment, usefulness, and ease of use. Among the TAM determinants, perceived enjoyment most significantly influenced their usage intention, followed by perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use. Multigroup analysis revealed that some relationships between app system success dimensions and TAM determinants were significantly different by gender. In addition, IPMA indicated that perceived enjoyment and system quality of branded sport apps were relatively more important than the other predictors. Originality/value The current study contributes to the literature by incorporating both TAM and ISSM and extending the TAM with the perceived enjoyment construct to examine the key determinants of usage intention in the context of branded sport apps.

AB The effect of weather and environmental conditions on sports has been extensively studied over the last few years. Most of the outdoor sport activities, and in particular endurance sports, are strongly influenced by the variation of meteorological parameters.
   Notwithstanding the conditions of the outdoor environment are often not considered when evaluating sport performances, as if they were not important, the sport performances are strongly related to the environmental conditions.
   The aim of this paper is to assess how much atmospheric variables may influence both the athletic performance and the comfort level for different sport disciplines. The analysis of a case study, focused on the cycling sport, shows how the computer supported training can help the Coaches and the Athletes to consider simultaneously the sport performance and the environmental data.

TI THE CURIOUS CASE FOR MEDIA MONOPOLY IN TECHNOLOGY-DRIVEN SPORTS
SO MEDIA INTERNATIONAL AUSTRALIA
AB This article examines the effect of technological change (innovation) on sports. We argue that innovation affects a sport through two pathways: sports equipment and sports media. We propose a simple economic model with positive feedback, which predicts that technology-enhanced sports will dominate the sports ecology. There is also the opposite phenomenon of technological overshooting that causes the elite end of a sport to develop much faster than the beginner's end, damaging entry into the sport. We present this model through a case study on windsurfing, illustrating the role of sports media. A surprising result is that the case study suggests a welfare-maximising case for monopoly licensing of sports media in newly emerging sports, or sports with rapidly changing equipment technologies.

The SWAM added Perceived Enjoyment (Davis et al, 1992) and Perceived Trustworthiness (Belanger et al, 2002) to the two factors Perceived Ease of Use and Perceived Usefulness used in the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) (Davis, 1989). This study proposes a competing model to the original SWAM and compares this by incorporating two additional constructs, Sport Involvement (Shank & Beasley, 1998) and Psychological Commitment to a Team (Mahony et al, 2000). Structural equation modeling analyses revealed acceptable model fits, both in the original SWAM and in the competing model. Subsequent analyses led the authors to conclude that the competing model was the better version of the SWAM.

TI eMuseum of sports: Digital and televised media impact stemming from the
   virtual galleries and exhibitions
SO JOURNAL OF HUMAN SPORT AND EXERCISE
AB Museums are important instruments for preserving a group's cultural memory and are responsible for its material or immaterial heritage. Furthermore, they participate in the tourism economy and in productive projects that contribute to the quality of life in the communities and regions in which they are located. Thus, in a period marked by the Coronavirus pandemic, with lockdowns going on in various parts of the world, online platforms for cultural consumption have been highlighted as a manner of guaranteeing entertainment and cultural access to the whole population. Thus, the present study aims to present the media impact results for the eMuseum of Sports in Brazilian digital and televised media. To fulfil this goal, the documental analysis technique was used to conduct a survey of the Sports eMuseum's impact through digital data. The internet data was obtained from the social networks Facebook and Instagram and the eMuseum's website, where all of its exhibits are concentrated. These digital communication media possess data analysis metrics that show how a certain post was followed by the public that uses these networks. Between April and October of 2020, the eMuseum of Sports launched 8 3D exhibits and 8 3D Galleries. On observing the gallery and exhibit contents in numbers, there are 184 collections (images or videos) in the exhibits and 560 in the galleries. At the end of this period, the total reach on the eMuseum's social networks arrived at the expressive number of almost 4 million and 300 thousand people impacted by the content that was created and organized by the eMuseum. The conclusion is that the eMuseum of Sports had a significant media coverage and allowed content to be accessed, strengthening the democratization of various sports content at a moment when other forms of in-person visitation would not be possible.

AB The study was conducted as part of the implementation of supplementary professional education programs aimed at developing the digital economy competencies of specialists in the field of "physical education and sports". In 2020, educational programs were implemented on various aspects of the digitalization of the physical culture and sports movement: from digital marketing of sports in general, to specific problems of promoting e-sports. The analysis of the primary data obtained during the students' reflection on the content of professional development programs allowed us to indicate the trends in the social demand of the physical education employees and sports sphere in the period of digital transformation, as well as to determine the current level of formation of digital competencies of specialists in physical culture and sports. The study allows us to discuss the following points: in the field of "physical education and sports" there are no systematic processes for the digital economy competencies formation; the professional standards of the physical culture and sports sphere do not fix labor actions related to the presence of digital economy competencies; educational organizations that train specialists in the physical culture and sports field should develop and implement educational programs and disciplines/modules aimed at the formation of both general professional and professional digital competencies.

TI Wearable Performance Devices in Sports Medicine
SO SPORTS HEALTH-A MULTIDISCIPLINARY APPROACH
AB Context: Wearable performance devices and sensors are becoming more readily available to the general population and athletic teams. Advances in technology have allowed individual endurance athletes, sports teams, and physicians to monitor functional movements, workloads, and biometric markers to maximize performance and minimize injury. Movement sensors include pedometers, accelerometers/gyroscopes, and global positioning satellite (GPS) devices. Physiologic sensors include heart rate monitors, sleep monitors, temperature sensors, and integrated sensors. The purpose of this review is to familiarize health care professionals and team physicians with the various available types of wearable sensors, discuss their current utilization, and present future applications in sports medicine.
   Evidence Acquisition: Data were obtained from peer-reviewed literature through a search of the PubMed database. Included studies searched development, outcomes, and validation of wearable performance devices such as GPS, accelerometers, and physiologic monitors in sports.
   Study Design: Clinical review.
   Level of Evidence: Level 4.
   Results: Wearable sensors provide a method of monitoring real-time physiologic and movement parameters during training and competitive sports. These parameters can be used to detect position-specific patterns in movement, design more efficient sports-specific training programs for performance optimization, and screen for potential causes of injury. More recent advances in movement sensors have improved accuracy in detecting high-acceleration movements during competitive sports.
   Conclusion: Wearable devices are valuable instruments for the improvement of sports performance. Evidence for use of these devices in professional sports is still limited. Future developments are needed to establish training protocols using data from wearable devices.

AB Wearable and mobile technologies hold the promise to be used 'on the move' as they are portable. It is common to listen to music during a run, track steps during the day, and have phone calls on the go. More advanced systems support, for example, athletes in increasing their performance, enhance their technique, and discuss sports data with a coach. To facilitate these experiences, providing such often multimodal feedback that is understandable, timely, and does not interfere with the sports activity is key. In this workshop, we will discuss multimodal feedback for sports so that more people can profit from wearable technologies. We will use prior work on truly mobile interaction as a framework analyze existing works and will hands-on explore various modalities to experience the pros and cons of modalities in motion.

AB Purpose The purpose of this paper is twofold: first, to investigate the effects of the digitalization process on the demand and supply side in the sports world through the advent of mobile apps and online services, such as YouTube, which provide free (or almost) real fitness courses; and second, to investigate how technological innovation is managed in the sports sector. Design/methodology/approach Drawing on a survey research approach, this study collected 150 questionnaires from consumers in the North of Italy. Findings Based on a descriptive analysis of the data, the findings show that the digital channel becomes significant at an exponential rate and takes on a leading role in today's era, especially among young people. However, the results also show that the traditional channel of use of the sports service (gyms/fitness centers) is privileged by consumers under the age of 35, even though there is a weak penetration of innovative tools offered by the innovation technology (mobile app and video tutorials on social networks such as YouTube) in the sports sector. Originality/value This study is among the few that connect the technological advancements and management within the sports industry and provides the ground and theoretical basis for the scholar community to further build on.

SO INTERNATIONAL SPORTS LAW JOURNAL
AB From the use of polyurethane swimsuits to carbon fibre-plated shoes for road racing, the term 'techno-doping' has been commonly used in categorising the use of technology as 'strategies' for performance enhancement in sports. There are various types of 'strategies' which are regularly (and increasingly) used by athletes to enhance their performance, especially in elite sports, such as the use of actual substances, methods of administering substances, and other modes of 'strategies' which have the effect of enhancing the performance of the athletes. However, it is curious that at present, only few 'Performance-Enhancing Strategies' ('PESs') are regulated, such as the use of Performance-Enhancing Drugs and methods ('PEDs') under the World Anti-Doping Agency ('WADA') Code. There are other PESs which are wholly unregulated, such as the use of nutrition and haematology, environmental factors, physiology testing opportunities, and sports equipment and technology [hereinafter known as Non-Doping Performance-Enhancing Strategies ('NDPESs')]. This paper discusses the unequal treatment between the regulation of PEDs and NDPESs in elite sports, and will conclude that steps ought to be taken in order to harmonise the treatment and regulation of all PESs in elite sports.

TI SURFACE ELECTROMYOGRAPHY AND MUSCLE TESTING TECHNOLOGY FOR TREATMENT OF
   SHOULDER JOINT SPORTS INJURY
SO ACTA MEDICA MEDITERRANEA
AB Shoulder joint injury is one of the most common in various sports. If treated improperly, athletes' body health and sports career will be adversely affected. In order to provide more scientific and intuitive guidance basis for clinical treatment of shoulder joint injury, an in-depth analysis on clinical effect of surface electromyography and muscle testing technology for treatment of shoulder joint injury was carried out. In this study, 1,200 shoulder joint injury patients were selected as observation group research objects; 500 athletes without sports injury were additionally selected as control group research objects. Both groups received surface electromyography and isokinetic muscle testing, with test results of the two groups compared. The results of surface electromyography and isokinetic muscle testing showed significant differences between observation group and control group patients' shoulder joint in angular velocity, abduction supraspinatus, infraspinatus IEMG. Difference between the groups P <0.05, with significant statistical significance. It can thus be concluded that after athletes have shoulder joint injury, muscles, joints of associated parts will undergo obvious changes. With surface electromyography and isokinetic muscle testing technology, full and accurate assessment of changed muscle function, status can be made, thereby providing valuable basis for treatment of shoulder joint injury. Therefore, surface electromyography and isokinetic muscle testing technology have significant clinical value in diagnosis of shoulder joint injuries.

SO EDUCATION AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGIES
AB Research objectives: specify the framework of using cutting-edge approaches and innovations in the training of rehabilitation physicians; investigate existing innovative technologies; get an insight into the motivation of students majoring in rehabilitation when working with the Gross simulator in sports rehabilitation of patients. The research was conducted at a mixed-type rehabilitation center for disabled adults and children at Soochow University in China. The study was conducted among 200 students majoring in rehabilitation at Soochow University and 100 children from a rehabilitation center with motor disorders: 50 boys and 50 girls. The patients were aged 4-6 years, and the average age of the participating students was 21 years. The students were offered a 6-month training course in rehabilitation of patients with musculoskeletal disorders, by using innovative technology-the Gross simulator. Student motivation analysis yielded the following outcomes: 90% of the students said that training to operate simulators is useful for the rehabilitation specialist, because this affects the proficiency of such specialist; 15% of students reported they did not like innovative technology in teaching because they faced difficulties in understanding it; 80% of students believed such technology facilitated the learning, and 5% of students were neutral. Further studies, conducted on clinical research sites, might address the effectiveness of training rehabilitation specialists, the use of cutting-edge simulators and robotic systems, as well as development of rehabilitation protocols for patients with injuries and musculoskeletal disorders.

TI The technologies of the self: Sport, feminism, and Foucault
SO SOCIOLOGY OF SPORT JOURNAL
AB Following Michel Foucault, feminist sport scholars have demonstrated how women's physical activity can act as a technology of domination that anchors women into a discoursive web of normalizing practices. There has been less emphasis on Foucault's later work that focuses on the individual's role of changing the practices of domination. Foucault argues that human beings turn themselves into subjects through what he labels "the technologies of the self." While his work is not gender specific, some feminists have seen the technologies of the self as a possibility to reconceptualize the self, agency and resistance in feminist theory and politics. In this paper, I aim to examine what Foucault's technologies of self can offer feminists in sport studies. I begin by reviewing applications of Foucault's technology of the self to analyses of women's physical activity. I will next locate the technologies of the self within Foucault's theory of power, self and ethics to further reflect how valuable this concept can be for feminist sport studies.

AB The amount of exercise and fitness level of sports athletes can be quantitatively evaluated through the measurement of health and sports information, thereby ensuring effective fitness effects. The development of blockchain and Internet of Things technology provides a new perspective and technical means for fitness management technology. In view of the current problems in the field of sports fitness, this paper designs and implements a dynamic management technology for sports fitness based on the concept of Internet of Things and blockchain. First, based on an in-depth analysis of the current status of theoretical research and application of the Internet of health at home and abroad, the theories and methods of sports information and health information collection are studied. A temperature sensor and an acceleration sensor are used to collect human body temperature and exercise steps, respectively, and then estimate human health and exercise conditions. Second, solve the privacy problem in the collection and transmission of the Internet of Things by adding blockchain technology. Finally, the machine-learning method is used to clean and manage the information and data to realize the real-time detection and management of the athlete's fitness status. The actual case test shows that the functions and technical performance indicators of the dynamic fitness management technology can meet the needs of users in indoor and outdoor fitness management, and promote the development of the sports industry and provide a scientific reference.

CL Brussels, BELGIUM
AB Those with lower limb disabilities are often dependent on manually propelled wheelchairs for their mobility, in Europe today some 3.3 million people. This implies a transfer from leg to arm work for ambulation and all other activities of daily living (ADL). Compared to the legs, arm work is less efficient and more straining, and leads to a lower physical capacity. Also, there is a major risk of mechanical overuse. Problems of long-term wheelchair use are not only pain or discomfort, but also a risk of a physically inactive lifestyle. Subsequently, serious secondary impairments (obesity, diabetes and cardiovascular problems) may eventually emerge. Wheelchair quality, including the ergonomic fitting to the individual may play a preventive role here, but also other modes of physical activity, and the understanding of training, rehabilitation, active lifestyle and sports on health and wellbeing. The 'International Classification of Functioning, Health and Disability' (ICF) model, a stress-strain-work capacity model, as well as the ergonomics model that relates human-activity-assistive technology are instrumental to the concepts, structure and aims of research in assistive technology for mobility. Apart from empirical developments and innovations from within wheelchair sports, systematic research has played a role in wheelchair development and design in three important areas: (1) the vehicle mechanics, (2) the human movement system and (3) the wheelchair-user interface. Current practical developments in design and technology are discussed. A position stand on the key-issues of a current and future research agenda in this area is presented. (c) 2005 IPEM.

TI Concurrent-Validity and Reliability of Photocells in Sport: A Systematic
   Review
SO JOURNAL OF HUMAN KINETICS
AB Specific physical qualities such as sprint running, change-of-direction or jump height are determinants of sports performance. Photocell systems are practical and easy to use systems to assess the time from point A to point B. In addition, these photoelectric systems are also used to obtain the time of vertically displaced movements. Knowing the accuracy and precision of photocell timing can be a determinant of ensuring a higher quality interpretation of results and of selecting the most appropriate devices for specific objectives. This systematic review aimed to identify and summarize studies that have examined the validity and reliability of photocells in sport sciences. A systematic review of PubMed, SPORTDiscus, and Web of Science databases was performed according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. From the 164 studies initially identified, 16 were fully reviewed, and their outcome measures were extracted and analyzed. Photocells appear to have a strong agreement with force plates (gold standard), but are not interchangeable to measure the vertical jump. For monitoring horizontal displacement, double beam systems, compared to single beam systems, are more valid and reliable when it comes to avoiding false triggers caused by swinging arms or legs.

   in sport with a disability: A mixed method approach
SO COGENT ENGINEERING
AB In able-bodied sport, controversy has occasionally been caused through the adoption or introduction of sports technology. However, scant attention has specifically been paid to sport with a disability with respect to such concerns. This article therefore investigates the use of lower limb running prostheses (LLRPs) in competition by below-knee amputees. This study uses a four-phase mixed method approach to investigate the nature, use and assessment of LLRPs. The first phase conducted a statistical analysis of the sports time series data to ascertain the progression of the sport when considering the impact of sports technology. The second phase performed a stakeholder assessment of the sport using the Delphi method and provided a proposed series of guidelines for lower limb prostheses technology inclusion. The third phase assessed the behaviour of LLRPs in a competitive environment. Ultimately, the three previous phases provided information that led to the fourth phase. This phase investigated the use of a dynamic drop jump technique as an assessment strategy for further development in the future. This information would prove of intrinsic value when developing sports policy in the future.

AB Purpose Professional sports organizations have a long tradition of utilizing stories as part of their marketing efforts. However, as the media landscape has undergone considerable change as a result of information and communication technologies, most notably through social media, the conditions under which storytelling evolve have altered significantly. Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to explain how storytelling in the sports sector becomes integrated in social media.
   Design/methodology/approach A conceptual review in three sequential steps is carried out. First, extant literature on the role and effects of storytelling is reviewed. This is followed by a review of the interplay between storytelling and the contemporary media landscape, with a particular focus on social media. Third, the authors link both literatures and, by doing so, illustrate the dynamic interplay of storytelling and social media in the sports sector.
   Findings The conceptual review shows that storytelling can enact four sequential roles that are characterized by varying degrees of co-creation which, in relation to extant literature, has strong implications for the manageability of storytelling from the perspective of professional sports organizations.
   Originality/value Based on the identified sequential roles that storytelling can enact in social media, this paper contributes to the field of sports marketing by depicting how the dynamics between storytelling and the social media landscape exhibit a shifting degree of manageability with regards to storytelling from the perspective of professional sports organizations.

TI New Metaphorical Models in Modern Sports Discourse
SO NAUCHNYI DIALOG
AB The cognitive and linguocultural aspects of metaphor implementation in Russian linguoculture are considered on the basis of figurative words and expressions in sports discourse. The novelty of the study lies in revealing the fact that more and more new conceptual areas are involved in presenting sporting events and building communication with reader: various terms of IT technologies, the world of TV series and computer games, while new stable systems of comparison begin to form: "sport" - "virtual computer world", "sport" - "series". The relevance of the study is confirmed by the use of terms from computer games and TV series that help to form an assessment of events or persons in the world of sports. It is noted that the study of metaphors is of great importance not only for the study of various types of discourse, but also for understanding the algorithms for mastering the picture of the world. At the same time, it is recognized that the main regular metaphors of sports discourse are based on the interaction of such conceptual areas as "sport" - "war", "sport" - "show", "sport" - "labor". It is clarified that the focus of this article is on new conceptual areas that enrich and expand human understanding of sports.

Design: Prospective cohort study. Methods: Amateur, adult athletes (16-38 years old) were diagnosed with sport-related concussion at a university-affiliated hospital emergency department. Participants were assessed within one-week, upon medical clearance to return to sporting activity, two weeks following return to sporting activity, six months, and 12 months following sport-related concussion. We assessed sex-, age-, and activity matched non-injured, control participants at matched time-points. Participants were asked during each study assessment whether they were participating in any sport, in a different sport than before their sport-related concussion, in the same sport but at a lower level of competition than before their sport related concussion, or in the same sport at the same level of competition than before their sport-related concussion. Results: Fifty concussed participants and 50 non-injured, control participants completed the study. The median times taken to receive clearance to return to sporting activity and to return to pre-injury level of sport competition following sport-related concussion were 13 days (95%CI = 12,16) and 31 days (95%CI = 28,32), respectively. One-year following sport-related concussion, 52% of participants reported that they were no longer participating in the same sport and at the same level of competition as they were before their sport-related concussion, compared with only 24% of participants in the non-injured, control group (p = 0.003). Conclusions: A greater percentage of athletes in the concussion group were not participating at their perceived pre-injury level of sport competition one-year following sport-related concussion compared with a non-injured control group. Factors that explain the lower proportion of amateur athletes participating at their pre-injury level of sport competition one-year after sport-related concussion are likely multifaceted and should be considered in future investigations.

TI The Introduction and Application of Sports Analytics in Professional
   Sport Organizations A Case Study of the Tampa Bay Lightning
SO JOURNAL OF APPLIED SPORT MANAGEMENT
AB While professional sports organizations continue to seek techniques to augment their on-field success, the growth of sports analytics has concurrently become increasingly competitive and complex. However, despite these recent developments and availability of data, much of the information shared between organizations, academicians, and practitioners is often limited and anecdotal. In this paper, we sought to provide a brief overview of analytics and subsequently share several best practice examples of how one National Hockey League (NHL) franchise, the Tampa Bay Lightning, integrates analytical techniques into several core business entities. An organizational emphasis on Customer Relationship Management (CRM) provides management with valuable data about their customers' current purchasing habits and potentially may predict future purchases. In addition, analytical techniques have assisted the organization in developing and implementing both dynamic and variable ticket pricing strategies to procure additional revenues. We conclude the paper with suggestions for future research and applications.

TI Flopping, mapping and gene doping: Dichotomies between 'natural' and
   'artificial' in elite sport
SO SOCIAL STUDIES OF SCIENCE
CT Meeting on Extreme Bodies
CY NOV, 2003
CL Maastricht, NETHERLANDS
AB The application of genetic technology seems to threaten what is considered natural in elite sport. This paper explores the role of genetic technology in elite sport and questions the significance of clichotomizing between the natural and artificial element. How do shifts in technology affect the attribution of the human element in athletic performance? To explore the attribution of human agency we compare the genetic enhancement of athletes with two other shifts of the 'natural performance' in sport: first, the introduction of a revolutionary high jump technique, the Fosbury flop, in 1968; and, second, the introduction of the klapskate in speed skating in 1997. The three cases show that artificiality as such can hardly be a criterion for evaluating processes of innovation. The context of elite sport is itself highly artificial. Boundaries between the natural body and the enhanced body are the outcome of institutional processes of boundary work. When discussing new technologies in sport it is better to ask if athletes are still playing the same game and whether or not there are equal opportunities and an equal distribution of means for playing the game. The introduction of gene technology may result in inequalities, with great impact on the outcome of the game. This outcome may be considered irrelevant for the inequalities that the game is supposed to produce and measure. Genetic enhancement may also threaten the public view of athletes as moral agents and possibly change the appreciation for human performance.

TI State-of-the-art review of athletic wearable technology: What 113
   strength and conditioning coaches and athletic trainers from the USA
   said about technology in sports
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPORTS SCIENCE & COACHING
AB Wearables are a multi-billion-dollar business with more growth expected. Wearable technology is fully entrenched at multiple levels of athletic competition, especially at the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) and professional levels where these solutions are used to gain competitive advantages by assessing health and performance of elite athletes. However, through the National Science Foundation (NSF) Innovation Corps (I-Corps) training experience, a different story emerged based on pilot interviews from coaches and trainers regarding the lack of trust in wearables, and how the technology falls short of measuring what practitioners need. An NSF I-Corps project was funded to interview over 100 strength and conditioning coaches (S&CCs) and athletic trainers (ATs) regarding the current state of wearables at the NCAA and professional levels. Through 113 unstructured interviews, a conceptual map of relationships amongst themes and sub-themes regarding wearable technology emerged through the grouping of responses into meaning units (MUs). Interview findings revealed that discussions by S&CCs and ATs regarding wearables could be grouped into themes tied to (a) the organizational environment, (b) the athlete, and (c) the analyst or data scientist. Through this project, key findings and lessons learned were aggregated into sub-themes including: the sports ecosystem and organizational structure, brand development, recruiting, compliance and gamification of athletes, baselining movement and injury mitigation, internal and external loads, "return tos," and quantifying performance. These findings can be used by practitioners to understand general technology practices and where to close the gap between what is available versus what is needed.

AB The purpose of this research is to evaluate how audiovisual sports advertising influences the self-perception and the socio-cultural perception of sedentary individuals. The goal is to understand the effect of the marketing strategies used by sports industry's brands in order to create more effective audiovisual sports advertising.
   This research explores the influence of sports audiovisual content in sedentary and athletic individuals, creating a bridge between sports advertising and body image. A bridge that many authors have identified to be missing.
   This research integrates a qualitative research strategy in a quasi-experimental approach, using mixed methods. Specifically, by applying an exploratory Online Research Survey on a heterogeneous population. And conducting a Focus Group Research with a sample of sedentary individuals from the Aveiro Municipality. The evaluation was accomplished through the screening of a sports video in the second session of the Focus Group Research in which, after a 10-minute workout, the participants' behaviors were assessed with the use of an Observation Grid and a post-workout discussion. These methods were progressively used in order to cross information and contribute in the design of the sequential investigation steps.
   We've come to the conclusions that there is a high chance that audiovisual sports advertising has a detrimental effect on both sedentary and athletic individuals. The main findings of this research identified that, although the Focus Group participants did not verbally confirm it, the video appeared to have a motivational effect on participants. They revealed a better performance and a more focused attitude during the test session. Sedentary individuals seem to be more critical of the female body than athletic individuals and, as opposed to individuals who consider themselves athletic, individuals who consider themselves sedentary will less likely feel especially motivated to exercise when watching inspirational fitness videos. In addition, gender does not seem to be correlated with sports advertising, sports apparel or gear seems to especially motivate athletic individuals to exercise and individuals' self-perception seems to be correlated to their workout motivations.

AB Background Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the USA. Therefore, it is important to review the contribution of ultraviolet radiation (UVR) exposure to skin cancer in individuals with the highest risk. Documenting the relationship between outdoor sports solar ultraviolet exposure and their risk of skin cancer along with appropriate risk mitigation strategies can help inform clinicians of practical information for counseling sun protective behaviors in this population. Methods We conducted a review of the current evidence using PubMed to answer the following research questions: (1) How is ultraviolet radiation measured? (2) What is the modern utility of the ultraviolet index in modifying recreational sun protection behaviors? (3) What is the risk of developing skin cancer for outdoor sport participants? (4) What is the prevalence of skin cancer in sport participants? and (5) Is the number of nevi and solar lentigines elevated in outdoor sport participants? Results Based on the literature, individuals who practice outdoor sport-related activities receive high ultraviolet radiation exposure, have a high risk for skin cancer, have a high prevalence for pigmented lesions, and may benefit from electronic sun protection educational interventions. Conclusions Individuals who practice outdoor sports experience substantially higher ultraviolet radiation exposure, routinely exceed the recommended exposure limits, and are at a higher risk of developing skin cancer. Therefore, those who are frequently engaged in outdoor leisure activities should be coached about efficient sun protective practices and relevant mobile technologies that may facilitate adherence.

TI The Moral Gatekeeper: Soccer and Technology, the Case of Video Assistant
   Referee (VAR)
SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB Video assistant referee was officially introduced into soccer regulations in 2018, after many years in which referee errors were justified as being "part of the game." The technology's penetration into the soccer field was accompanied by concerns and much criticism that, to a large degree, continues to be voiced with frequency. This paper argues that, despite fierce objections and extensive criticism, VAR represents an important revision in modern professional soccer, and moreover, it completes a moral revolution in the evolution of the sport as a whole. Theoretically speaking, this technology enables an improvement in the sport's professional standards and its public image and prestige, and especially its moral standards - Fair play. Furthermore, the introduction of this technology makes it possible to discover additional weaknesses (Standardization for extra time, a clear definition of a handball offense and more) that professional soccer regulations will probably be forced to address in the future.

SO LOISIR & SOCIETE-SOCIETY AND LEISURE
AB Technical innovation is not separated from the social so much, but it is difficult to mix the two types of innovation. It is possible to arrange innovations along a continuum where, at one pole, social innovations are conditioned by technical innovations and, at the other, social innovations are first and autonomous. Social innovations (way of living together activities), in climbing or in diving, have been conditioned by the technical innovations of safety equipment. Social innovation, in this case, is consistent with the increased use of technology. But, social innovations can be more independent from technical innovations (adventure parks do not add new technologies to the equipment used in the army, but the ways of living together are different). Users become central in social innovation in outdoor sports. Involvement of the players is an essential condition for successful innovation.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPORTS MARKETING & SPONSORSHIP
AB PurposeThe purpose of the current study was to determine whether AI can assist sport managers in the challenging space of salesperson training through the evaluation of interactions with prospective ticket buyers.Design/methodology/approachA total of 397 inside sales calls for a National Basketball Association (NBA) team were transcribed and analyzed. Unsupervised topic modeling was conducted using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA), a machine learning technique for identifying latent themes or topics within a textual corpus. Additionally, sentiment analysis was conducted using text mining to generate sentiment polarity scores for sales call interactions. Finally, panel analysis through Ridge regression was conducted to assess appropriate model fit across evaluations of sales interactions.FindingsFindings showed that sales agents who use a more diverse vocabulary are more likely to generate positive customer responses and achieve successful sales. Sales representatives who employ a more diverse vocabulary (higher lexical diversity) tend to exhibit positive sentiment polarity. Additionally, a moderate speaking pace contributed to more favorable customer perceptions. Finally, a positive association between the number of questions asked per call and open-ended questions was found, indicating agents who engage in more in-depth questioning strategies are better equipped to gather comprehensive information from customers.Originality/valueGuided by the Technology-Task-Fit theory, the current study examined the role of AI-analysis in assessing sport ticket sales calls and assisting in salesperson training. The current study provides support for the use of AI in sales training through analyzing sales conversations and detecting differences in sales calls among successful and unsuccessful outcomes. These results demonstrate that AI can effectively analyze sales calls and provide evidence-based applicable feedback to sales agents.

TI Wearable device for continuous sweat lactate monitoring in sports: a
   narrative review
SO FRONTIERS IN PHYSIOLOGY
AB In sports science, the use of wearable technology has facilitated the development of new approaches for tracking and assessing athletes' performance. This narrative review rigorously explores the evolution and contemporary state of wearable devices specifically engineered for continuously monitoring lactate levels in sweat, an essential biomarker for appraising endurance performance. Lactate threshold tests have traditionally been integral in tailoring training intensity for athletes, but these tests have relied on invasive blood tests that are impractical outside a laboratory setting. The transition to noninvasive, real-time monitoring through wearable technology introduces an innovative approach, facilitating continuous assessment without the constraints inherent in traditional methodologies. We selected 34 products from a pool of 246 articles found through a meticulous search of articles published up to January 2024 in renowned databases: PubMed, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect. We used keywords such as "sweat lactate monitoring," "continuous lactate monitoring," and "wearable devices." The findings underscore the capabilities of noninvasive sweat lactate monitoring technologies to conduct long-term assessments over a broad range of 0-100 mM, providing a safer alternative with minimal infection risks. By enabling real-time evaluations of the lactate threshold (LT) and maximal lactate steady state (MLSS), these technologies offer athletes various device options tailored to their specific sports and preferences. This review explores the mechanisms of currently available lactate monitoring technologies, focusing on electrochemical sensors that have undergone extensive research and show promise for commercialization. These sensors employ amperometric reactions to quantify lactate levels and detect changes resulting from enzymatic activities. In contrast, colorimetric sensors offer a more straightforward and user-friendly approach by displaying lactate concentrations through color alterations. Despite significant advancements, the relationship between sweat lactate and blood lactate levels remains intricate owing to various factors such as environmental conditions and the lag between exercise initiation and sweating. Furthermore, there is a marked gap in research on sweat lactate compared to blood lactate across various sports disciplines. This review highlights the need for further research to address these shortcomings and substantiate the performance of lactate sweat monitoring technologies in a broader spectrum of sports environments. The tremendous potential of these technologies to supplant invasive blood lactate tests and pioneer new avenues for athlete management and performance optimization in real-world settings heralds a promising future for integrating sports science and wearable technology.

TI Twitter as Disruptive Innovation in Sport Communication
SO COMMUNICATION & SPORT
AB This Twitter Research Forum essay by Ann Pegoraro, one of the leading sport management and marketing scholars on social media, focuses on the need to study Twitter as a disruptive innovation in sport communication. Making a case that Twitter has disrupted the one-to-many, single-medium framework of sport consumption traditionally offered by television to the many-to-many possibilities of Internet-enabled sport participatory consumption, Pegoraro poses that Twitter's disruptiveness is distinctive in that it was up to the users to define how this platform would be used. Noting varied response to research on Twitter and sport, it is argued that the research process and the building of theory is necessarily not a neat and tidy direct line process. In observing that much research on Twitter and sport to date has ported many of the categories of research agendas and key theories that have driven earlier research on media and sport, the essay concludes that the research process that has been started portends hope for future comprehensive theoretical analysis.

TI Animated VR and 360-degree VR to assess and train team sports
   decision-making: a scoping review
SO FRONTIERS IN PSYCHOLOGY
AB Introduction: In team sports, athletes' ability to make quick decisions plays a crucial role. Decision-making proficiency relies on the intricate balance of athletes' perceptual and cognitive abilities, enabling them to assess the competitive environment swiftly and select the most appropriate actions from various options. Virtual reality (VR) technology is emerging as a valuable tool for evaluating and refining athletes' decision-making skills. This study systematically examined the integration of VR technology into decision-making processes in team sports, aiming to identify more effective methods for presenting and interacting with virtual decision-making systems, thus enhancing the evaluation and refinement of athletes' decision making abilities. Methods: Following the preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, a thorough search of respected research databases, including Web of Science, PubMed, SPORTDiscus, ScienceDirect, PsycINFO, and IEEE, was conducted using carefully selected keywords. Results: Twenty research papers meeting predefined inclusion criteria were included after careful evaluation. These papers were systematically analyzed to delineate the attributes of virtual decision-making task environments, the interactive dynamics inherent in motor decision-making tasks, and the significant findings Discussion:This review indicate that (1) the effectiveness of VR technology in assessing and improving athletes' decision-making skills in team sports; (2) the construction of virtual environments using the Head-Mounted Display (HMD) system, characterized by enhanced ease and efficiency; (3) the potential for future investigations to explore computer simulations to create more expansive virtual motion scenarios, thus efficiently generating substantial task scenario material, diverging from the constraints posed by 360-degree panoramic videos; and (4) the integration of motion capture technology for identifying and monitoring athletes' decision-making behaviors, which not only enhances ecological validity but also augments the transfer validity of virtual sports decision-making systems. Future research endeavors could explore integrating eye-tracking technology with virtual reality to gain insights into the intrinsic cognitive-action associations exhibited by athletes.

TI Assessment Of The Quality Of Paralympic Sports In Sports Clubs For
   Disabled People In Russia
SO RESEARCH JOURNAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL BIOLOGICAL AND CHEMICAL SCIENCES
AB Recently, health-saving and health-restoring technologies for the disabled are increasingly being used in Russia. A prominent place among them is the Paralympic sport. Despite its active development, in most regions of Russia there is a low satisfaction of persons with lesions of the musculoskeletal system by the quality of their training in sports clubs. The most low among the disabled are the available specialists and trainers who work with disabled people, the level of literacy training programs for disabled people, the opportunity to participate in competitions abroad and exchange experiences with foreign athletes. Also there is a low possibility of meetings with disabled athletes and their coaches from other cities. To improve the effectiveness of sports clubs and the competent organization of the training process on Paralympic sports in the regions of Russia, it is necessary to improve the scientifically based system of training trainers and athletes in Paralympic sports, use a clear scientific approach in drawing up a training plan, and expand the program of competitions and friendly meetings. It becomes clear that in case of solving these problems, Paralympic sport in Russia will be raised to a qualitatively higher level.

TI Rejecting Technology: A Normative Defense of Fallible Officiating
SO SPORT ETHICS AND PHILOSOPHY
AB There is a growing consensus in both academic and popular reflections on sport that if the accuracy of officiating can be improved by technology, then such assistance ought to be introduced. Indeed, apart from certain practical concerns about technologizing officiating there are few normative objections, and those that are voiced are often poorly articulated and quickly dismissed by critics. In this paper, we take up one of these objections - what is referred to as the loss of the human element in sport - and try to provide a firmer foundation for the disquiet that some feel at the threat of its loss. Briefly, it is argued that the cost of trying to eliminate all error in officiating through technological means is an understanding of sport as a practice through which human beings can reconcile themselves with the fallibilities and contingencies of life, in a forum where such losses can safely be experienced. After considering both practical and normative counter-arguments against the implementation of technology to correct officiating errors, we offer an argument that fallible officiating should be seen as desirable and that an attitude in sport that seeks to eliminate all wrong decision-making in officiating should be discouraged.

TI Artificial Intelligence Program for Predicting Wrestlers' Sports
   Performances
SO SPORTS
AB To date, there are conflicting opinions about the effectiveness of the introduction of artificial intelligence technologies in sports. In this regard, the purpose of the study was to develop and integrate an intellectual program for predicting competitive success into the process of selecting wrestlers to increase its effectiveness. The authors developed a program for predicting the sports performance of wrestlers on the basis of artificial intelligence technology. To implement the study, the individual data of Greco-Roman wrestlers (n = 72) were collected and processed on 36 comparison traits, ranked into categories according to three key areas: sports space, hereditary data and individual achievements. As a result of data processing through means of deep neural networks and machine learning algorithms, two prediction categories were identified: athletes who performed at the sport rank or the highest standard and athletes who did not achieve this standard. Control testing of the created program showed only 11% of error probability in predicting a given wrestler's competitive performance. As for the functionality of the program in the area of classification of the features by category, the authors' artificial intelligence program with 100% probability identified key categories of traits that reliably affect the results of the future sports performance of a young wrestler. Thus, the use of neural networks and machine learning algorithms, according to the results of the study, improves the quality of sports selection, which will allow further timely individualization and improvement of the training process of young wrestlers.

SO REVIEW OF MANAGERIAL SCIENCE
AB This article examines the state of research on sport entrepreneurship, with a particular focus on the intersection of entrepreneurship, innovation, and creativity in sport management. Sport is an increasingly important sector of the global economy, yet little attention has been given to the role of entrepreneurship in its development. This article argues that entrepreneurship, innovation, and creativity are crucial drivers of change, innovation, and employment in sport and that sport entrepreneurship is an emerging but unorganized stream of business research. To better understand the relationship between these research fields, we performed a study that combined a systematic review and a bibliometric analysis. This article presents thematic shifts in the field of sport entrepreneurship, innovation, and creativity. It proposes an integrated model of sport entrepreneurship, offering novel perspectives that contribute to the field. Furthermore, the article addresses the lack of research on creativity, sustainability, and the sport entrepreneur, charting underexplored territories. Overall, this article provides a comprehensive overview of current research on sport entrepreneurship and identifies key areas for future investigation.

AB The design of sport buildings has great impact on top-sport as well as on recreational sport-activities. It implies challenging tasks in meeting the performance-requirements. This includes the control of factors like daylight/lighting, air flow, thermal conditions, just to name a few. Such factors impact the performance of athletes and are hard to control in large sport halls; their control is even harder when the public/audience is located within the halls and require different climate conditions. While mechanical installations are often needed during competitions in order to guarantee constant conditions, relaying on mechanical installations during the daily and recreational use of the venues challenges their medium/long term sustainability. Computational form finding approaches can favour the achievement of high-performing and sustainable sport buildings. In this light, the paper tackles the use of Multi-objective and Multidisciplinary design optimization. The paper presents the concept of Multi-objective Multidisciplinary design optimization techniques to support trade-off decisions between multiple conflicting design objectives and interdisciplinary design methodology, during the conceptual design of sport buildings. The proposed method is based on parametric modelling, performance simulation tools and algorithms for computational optimization, for which the paper tackles three specific aspects. First of all, due to the complexity of large sport buildings, the formulation of the optimization and the screening of the related design variables is crucial in order to obtain a meaningful design space, which helps reducing unnecessary computational burden. Secondly, assessing performance based on measurements and analyses is crucial and can be supported by performance simulations tools; however effectively integrating performance simulations tools in the early phase of the design requires new tools. In this light, a customized computational process for the rapid assessment of temperature and airflow patterns is presented. Thirdly, the process requires the combination of design optimization and design exploration, while searching for well-performing solutions. The importance of design exploration is emphasized also for suboptimal solutions. In order to facilitate the design exploration, the combination of optimization algorithms, multi-variate analysis algorithms and options for exploring design solutions via an interactive dashboard connected to a database are presented. To exemplify the method, specific case studies are developed as collaboration between Delft university of Technology and South China university of Technology. (C) 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.

AB In the fields of politics, history and international relations, the phrase sport diplomacy has attracted a growing multi-disciplinary interest in debate around relations between different actors. In this article we trace the emergence of academic literature connected to sport diplomacy and further identify the relevant empirical, conceptual and theoretical frames used to study sport diplomacy. Using an integrated review approach, we collected peer-reviewed journal articles published between 2000 and 2020, with 224 articles subsequently analysed for key attributes such as research location and type of diplomacy. The results and discussion support and challenge some current tropes connected to sport diplomacy research, such as the overreliance on case studies, lack of theoretical consistency and dominance of research from higher-income countries. Further, we highlight opportunities for scholars to develop empirical and theoretical bridges between fields to overcome disciplinary differences and engage with the growing organisational interest to operationalise sport diplomacy. This review of sport diplomacy literature and opens up lines of inquiry for sport management and sport development scholars to further advance our understanding of sport diplomacy.

TI Competition, Gender Equality, and Doping in Sports in the Red Queen
   Effect Perspective
SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The nature of sports is characterized by a strong competitive component that generates inequalities among athletes at different levels, specifically in relation to gender, technology, and doping. These inequalities can be represented according to the Red Queen effect perspective, which has been previously hypothesized in other competitive environments (evolutionary biology and economics, for instance). The Red Queen effect considers each competitive environment to require a constant effort to maintain a position of competitive advantage in order reach the best result possible. Therefore, the aim of the current paper is to provide an innovative perspective for the understanding of competition in sports, identifying factors (i.e., physical appearance for gender equality, socioeconomic status of a sport team for technology, and antidoping rules for doping) influencing athletes' possibilities to win a competition. Concerning gender differences, the disparity between genders reflects a lower coverage in sports news, and media are more likely to focus on female athletes' physical appearance than their performance in sports. Therefore, women struggle more with increasing their visibility and in affirming their status as an athlete. On the other hand, the introduction of science and technological innovations in sports has generated economic interests in sport competitions, which reached superior performance levels compared to the past. Teams that cannot afford financial burdens of technological innovation risk being left out from sport competitions. Finally, doping creates a Red Queen environment since antidoping rules catch a small portion of athletes using performance enhancement drugs.

AB Sports analytics aims to provide a competitive advantage to a team or individual in sports by analyzing a collection of relevant statistics. Better strategies in play can be formulated using the information. The core technology necessary for the analysis is the player detection and tracking. Due to limitation of fixed cameras, this work presents a court detection using markers, player detection and tracking using a drone. The method presented is based on perspective transformation, template matching and particle filters. In this work, we can visualize the movement trajectory of a player and extract the real world (on court) player position irrespective of drone height and position.

TI Wearable and telemedicine innovations for Olympic events and elite sport
SO JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE AND PHYSICAL FITNESS
AB Rapid advances in wearable technologies and real-time monitoring have resulted in major inroads in the world of recreational and elite sport. One such innovation is the application of real-time monitoring, which comprises a smartwatch application and ecosystem, designed to collect, process and transmit a wide range of physiological, biomechanical, bioenergetic and environmental data using cloud-based services. We plan to assess the impact of this wireless technology during Tokyo 2020, where this technology could help characterize the physiological and thermal strain experienced by an athlete, as well as determine future management of athletes during a medical emergency as a result of a more timely and accurate diagnosis. Here we describe some of the innovative technologies developed for numerous sports at Tokyo 2020 ranging from race walking (20 km and 50 km events), marathon, triathlon, road cycling (including the time trial event), mountain biking, to potentially team sports played outdoors. A more symbiotic relationship between sport, health and technology needs to be encouraged that harnesses the unique demands of elite sport (e.g., the need for unobtrusive devices that provide real-time feedback) and serves as medical and preventive support for the athlete's care. The implementation of such applications would be particularly welcome in the field of medicine (i.e., telemedicine applications) and the workplace (with particular relevance to emergency services, the military and generally workers under extreme environmental conditions). Laboratory and field-based studies are required in simulated scenarios to validate such emerging technologies, with the field of sport serving as an excellent model to understand and impact disease.

SO SCALABLE COMPUTING-PRACTICE AND EXPERIENCE
AB Scalability and Sustainability are a major traits that a website requires. Moreover, in Social sports management, information platforms must be reliable. Thus, different tools for developing a platform based on web technology are discussed in an empirical study for the purposes mentioned earlier. For the study, secondary data was analyzed, and qualitative methods were used. In addition, it was noticed that there are some problems related to a web technology-based platform. It was found that an improved development strategy in the beginning aids in traffic management. In addition, an improved tech stack is directly related to the data analysis process of a sports management system. A lack of such factors in the construction process reduced the scalability and sustainability of a social sports management information platform. Thus, a complete discussion aimed at understanding the sustainability and scalability of a web management platform is done.

AB Due to the rapid growth of machine learning technology, there is a need for research to automatically recognize objects and analyze their behavior in various fields, as is the case with sports. Currently, a system for detecting and tracking multiple objects in a sporting event is not accurate enough. Since most of the services depend on the manual operation of an experienced operator, it is necessary to develop a real time tracking technique for detecting the position of an object. In this paper, we propose an algorithm for multi - object tracking in a sporting event by presenting the results of comparing the performance of existing algorithms for multi-object tracking.

TI Data in Motion: Sports as a site for expansive learning
SO COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION
AB Background and Context: Sports and technology are often pitted as being at odds with one another. While there are several educational activities that make reference to sports we seldom see sports used as an authentic context for learning computing.
   Objective: We describe the design of Data in Motion, a curriculum that considers the bi-directional opportunities for sports to improve learning of STEM and for STEM to help improve participants' athletic performance.
   Method: We implement Data in Motion as a five-day summer camp with 33 participants, grades 2-6. We observe the ways that the experience changes students' perceptions of the connection between sports and technology through student surveys, observations and artifact analyses.
   Findings: Across the pool of participants, we saw significant changes in the ways that students conceptualized the connection between technology and athletic performance. We also saw students who are not interested in sports demonstrate high engagement in the experience.
   Implications: Practice-linked learning, specifically in the context of sports and technology, is a generative space for students to authentically explore interests in both disciplines. Researchers and practitioners should consider this intersection as a potential space to broaden modes of participation in computer science.

AB Sports play an integral part in promoting physical fitness and fostering the advancement of social civilization. Promoting the healthy development of sports involves guiding sports activities to return to green spaces and integrate with nature. This direction and choice are significant. Green sports aims to integrate sports, humanity, and ecology effectively, promoting a coordinated and symbiotic development of the sports industry. To investigate the influence of the green consumption concept on the demand for mass sports. In regions A, B, C, D, and others, we distributed a total of 650 questionnaires between March and May 2020. A total of 627 questionnaires were recovered, resulting in a recovery rate of 96.46%. A total of 595 questionnaires were considered valid, resulting in an effective rate of 94.90%. The study employed questionnaire surveys, mathematical statistics, and logical analysis to analyse the influencing factors, consumption level, and demand structure of mass sports consumption comprehensively and deeply in a province. Based on the results, the study deduced the development trend of mass sports in the province. The standard site density is 4.46 sites per 10,000 individuals, with a building area per person of 0.32m(2) and a site area per person of 0.81m(2). The sports ground has a total area of 85.78 million metres(2), with a building area of 68.55 million metres(2). The theme and crucial guarantee for the sustainable development of sports, as well as the focus of mass sports development in a Province in the new era, are correct guidance, reasonable planning, participation of the entire population, and the establishment of a mass sports civilization. In the development of green sports, it is crucial to focus on guiding participants towards the formation of appropriate values. In particular, Athletes and event organisers should prioritise the inherent value of sports and refrain from sacrificing it for the sake of maximising economic gains. It is crucial to prioritise guiding the public towards adopting a proper approach to sports. Exploring the convergence of sports technology and cultural development can help identify a rational path for the intelligent advancement of sustainable sports.

AB The growing sector of sport industry increases the demand of sport management specialists capable of using digital technologies in their work. Among the most important fields, in which they need to gain proficiency is data analytics, which is expected to revolutionize the sports in near future. This suggests developing and offering of relevant technology courses to sport management students. Various factors (briefly discussed in the sequel) make the design of such courses a challenging task. In this paper we share our experience of how one can overcome the possible obstacles. We present the main aspects and components of a course on Data Analytics in Sport Management at a small liberal arts college and explain how the educational process is organized. The course is offered by using mostly Open Educational Resources (OER) and other free sources which are described in the paper. This complies with the aspiration of many universities to achieve reduction of textbook cost for their students.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPORTS PHYSIOLOGY AND PERFORMANCE
AB Research describing load-monitoring techniques for team sport is plentiful. Much of this research is conducted retrospectively and typically involves recreational or semielite teams. Load-monitoring research conducted on professional team sports is largely observational. Challenges exist for the practitioner in implementing peer-reviewed research into the applied setting. These challenges include match scheduling, player adherence, manager/coach buy-in, sport traditions, and staff availability. External-load monitoring often attracts questions surrounding technology reliability and validity, while internal-load monitoring makes some assumptions about player adherence, as well as having some uncertainty around the impact these measures have on player performance This commentary outlines examples of load-monitoring research, discusses the issues associated with the application of this research in an elite team-sport setting, and suggests practical adjustments to the existing research where necessary.

AB Internet of Things (IoT) is a new frontier where scientists are currently experimenting with fascinating new ideas and items. Along with health-care and wellness, sports and recreational activities constitutes one of the most rapidly growing areas of personal and consumer-oriented Internet of Things technologies. This area of research is in its nascent stage of development and has been investigated by none till date. Though few companies have started working in this area, the methodology while manufacturing their products lack in standard architectural framework. Despite of huge market expectations, this filed of research lags far behind than other sectors of IoT. This literature investigates how sports and recreational activities can be augmented through novel services based on standard architecture of emerging IoT infrastructures. This paper envisages the Internet of Things for Sports (IoTSport) as the novel and state of the art framework which is capable to cater the needs of persuasion of current sports culture in a smart and handy way. Moreover, IoT for sports and recreational activities provide a new domain of research that includes several of the critical challenges which need to be taken care of. It is skeptical to the fact that the research output from this work would surely affect other domains such as health and rehabilitation in near future.

AB The Internet, as a kind of media, has become an important source for people to obtain a large amount of information due to its large information quantity and strong interaction, which has a profound impact on the lives of college students. How to guide students to use the Internet sports information for independent learning has become an important subject in college physical education. Taking Shenzhen University and Hunan University of Science and Technology as examples, this paper studies the influence of the Internet sports information on college physical education by the field investigation, questionnaire, comparative analysis and other research methods. The results show that the Internet sports information has a positive impact on college students' participation attitude, motivation and interest in sports. The time and frequency of access to the Internet sports information for college students are relevant to their sports self-organization and self-management behaviors, which affect college students' physical exercise time, frequency and intensity to varying degrees. This research provides practical basis for the role of the Internet sports information in college students' sports education.

AB Event spectating being the core motive for the passive sport tourism form has departed from the traditional live attendance to a more holistic sport participative experience. Increasingly, passive sport tourists play a crucial role into forming the received experience when interacting with crucial components of the event, athletes and peripheral services. There seems to be an effort from sport event owners and protagonists to engage visitors to an enriched spectating response based on technology and sport specific infrastructure that takes competition to a new leisure dimension. The present study focuses on the dimensions of this development as met throughout the corporate sport events suppliers, venues and organizers to produce understanding on the role of technology in the event visiting enrichment. The analysis engaging industry's technological expressions as well as sport venue cases where technology becomes the most competitive element, highlights and forecasts alterations to be met in the passive sport tourism experience overall. Data analytics and social media interaction become the initiating point for product formulation guiding sport and venue partners to design experiences derived from visitors expressed preferences through technological means. In addition, the use of social networks seems to increase the sport tourism markets as well as to reach market segments that would be difficult to identify, leading to the further development of passive sport tourism in total. Sport events and venues are accepting a new role as an extended technological and commercial stage where business, sport, tourism, technology and marketing partners are met to upgrade the spectating experience, though raising questions over the intrinsic value of sport competition.

TI Relationship of participation in specific sports to academic performance
   in adolescents: A 2-year longitudinal study
SO SCANDINAVIAN JOURNAL OF MEDICINE & SCIENCE IN SPORTS
AB Physical activity is considered a promising behavior to improve cognitive function and academic performance in adolescents. As evidence on the relationship of specific sports activity is not conclusive, this study aimed to determine the longitudinal relationships of different sports to academic performance in adolescents and evaluate the cardiorespiratory fitness mediation effect of these sports. We focused on the demands of complex motor skills and the differences between individual sports vs team sports. Four hundred and sixty-three 7th-grade students (227 girls and 236 boys) were followed up over 2 years. Data regarding participation in sports activities, types of sports activities, academic performance, and cardiorespiratory fitness were obtained at baseline and after a 2-year follow-up. Structural equation modeling revealed that participation in all sports activity was positively associated with improvement of academic performance from baseline to follow-up, and that these associations were mediated by cardiorespiratory fitness gains. Participation in sports activities that require more complex motor skills and individual sports activity was directly associated with an improvement of academic performance from baseline to follow-up. Furthermore, quitting sports activities was negatively associated with academic performance via a reversal in cardiorespiratory fitness gains. These findings indicate that participation in specific sports may have significant benefits for academic performance in adolescents. Although these relationships are presumably mediated by cardiorespiratory fitness, sports activities that require more complex motor skills and individual sports participation may be directly related to academic performance. Considering that quitting sports activities reversed these benefits, sustained participation in sports is important for academic success.

AB With the rapid development of science and technology and economy, it has a great impact on people's lifestyle and habits. Fewer and fewer people will actually carry out offline sports activities, and some will choose gyms and other places for offline exercise, but the high cost of gyms limits most people's desire to exercise. Our country has been actively introducing policies or measures to advocate physical exercise, but people's enthusiasm is not high or improper training leads to frequent physical injury. In view of the current situation and pain points of sports skill training, this paper first discusses the possibility of the overall application of virtual reality technology based on artificial intelligence in sports skill training. Secondly, it explores the application of virtual reality technology based on artificial intelligence in tennis, which is a highly skilled sports training. Finally, combined with the practical application of virtual reality technology based on artificial intelligence in sports skills training, it proves the advantages and influence of applying virtual reality technology based on artificial intelligence in sports skills training in the future.

AB This article provides a phenomenological understanding of contemporary sport and its digital game incarnation. The latter is highlighted as, currently, an example par excellence of what Martin Heidegger referred to as Enframing (Ge-Stell): the essence of modern technology that discloses being only in its availability for consumption. This concept is clarified and compared with a phenomenological comprehension of art and play. Building upon these notions, the physical sport and its digital emulation are compared and contrasted, illustrating how key criteria for play and artwork are met or nullified. Finally, we come to a diagnosis of the sport digital game in its current form, suggesting how it may meet these criteria through acknowledgement and appreciation of its technological basis.

TI Research on Human Sports Rehabilitation Design Based on Object-Oriented
   Technology
SO JOURNAL OF HEALTHCARE ENGINEERING
AB In order to improve the effect of human motion rehabilitation, a design model of human motion rehabilitation based on object-oriented technology is proposed. The entire model design process includes the following steps. First, a visual dynamic tracking model for human motion rehabilitation is established, and then a fuzzy PID (Proportion Integration Differentiation) superheterodyne control method is used to design the bone training control for human motion rehabilitation. The bone tracking control and adaptive training are under the control of object-oriented technology; it is analyzed by collecting human activity data during training. The 6-DOF kinematics problem of human movement rehabilitation is decomposed into the bone training control problem in the subspace. Combining object-oriented technology, visual blur recognition of human sports rehabilitation training, and adopting an adaptive kinematics model to design sports rehabilitation can improve the control convergence and global stability of the human sports rehabilitation process. The simulation results show that the method has a good overall steady state and the sports rehabilitation training effect is obvious.

AB In order to improve the teaching-learning process at the university level, it is essential to consolidate students' digital competences (DCs) during their initial training. This development is analysed in the area of sports management as part of the physical activity and sports science (CAFyD) bachelor's degree. Students (n = 236) from private (n = 120) and public (n = 116) universities participated by completing the COBADI questionnaire (registered trademark: 2970648 (R)), structured into three dimensions: (I) Competences in knowledge and use of ICTs in social communication and collaborative learning; (II) competences in the use of ICT for information search and processing; and (III) virtual and social communication tools of the university. Likert scale responses ranged from 1 to 4 points. The results show significant differences in terms of the type of university. In terms of gender, females have a better digital perception, with a significant difference ( horizontal ellipsis I know how to use programs horizontal ellipsis ). This pioneering research is of relevance for higher education professors in the field of sports, as it helps to detect areas where students lack DCs and engages them in the enhancement of their learning.

TI The performativity of sports statistics: towards a research agenda
SO JOURNAL OF CULTURAL ECONOMY
AB Statistical analysis has become increasingly integral to contemporary sports. Most existing studies, regardless of whether they endorse or criticise the growing influence of statistical analysis in professional sports, attribute agential capacities exclusively to humans. In this conceptual article, we challenge both what we call 'instrumentalist' and 'romantic' approaches by applying insights from the expanding literature on the performative effects of statistical models in economic markets to the area of sports. Rather than understanding statistics as mirrors of an objective reality, we conceptualise them as interventions in the analysis and conduct of sports. The use of sophisticated techniques for data collection and analysis by scouts, managers, referees and athletes has profound feedback effects on how these sports professionals come to understand their sport and seek to improve their performance. An interdisciplinary performative understanding of statistics allows for an unpacking of the socio-material mechanisms through which data-heavy analytical technologies shape processes of valuation, commercialisation and regulation in professional sports.

TI Ubiquitous Computing in Sports and Physical Activity-Recent Trends and
   Developments
SO SENSORS
AB The use of small, interconnected and intelligent tools within the broad framework of pervasive computing for analysis and assessments in sport and physical activity is not a trend in itself but defines a way for information to be handled, processed and utilised: everywhere, at any time. The demand for objective data to support decision making prompted the adoption of wearables that evolve to fulfil the aims of assessing athletes and practitioners as closely as possible with their performance environments. In the present paper, we mention and discuss the advancements in ubiquitous computing in sports and physical activity in the past 5 years. Thus, recent developments in wearable sensors, cloud computing and artificial intelligence tools have been the pillars for a major change in the ways sport-related analyses are performed. The focus of our analysis is wearable technology, computer vision solutions for markerless tracking and their major contribution to the process of acquiring more representative data from uninhibited actions in realistic ecological conditions. We selected relevant literature on the applications of such approaches in various areas of sports and physical activity while outlining some limitations of the present-day data acquisition and data processing practices and the resulting sensors' functionalities, as well as the limitations to the data-driven informed decision making in the current technological and scientific framework. Finally, we hypothesise that a continuous merger of measurement, processing and analysis will lead to the development of more reliable models utilising the advantages of open computing and unrestricted data access and allow for the development of personalised-medicine-type approaches to sport training and performance.

TI Advances in self-powered electrochemical systems for sports
   applications: Harnessing energy and sensing
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTROCHEMICAL SCIENCE
AB Recent advancements in electrochemical science are enabling the development of self-powered systems that address critical power and sensing needs in modern sports applications. This review highlights how electrochemical principles-primarily in energy conversion, storage, and sensing-underpin next-generation "smart" sports devices. Triboelectric and piezoelectric nanogenerators are focal points, as they harness biomechanical energy from athletic movements and impacts. These energy-harvesting transducers, when integrated with electrochemical storage elements such as batteries or supercapacitors, create self-sustaining power loops that eliminate the need for traditional external power supplies. The review discusses the fundamentals of electrochemical storage materials, including nanostructured metal oxides and carbon-based architectures, detailing how these materials facilitate robust, high-capacity energy buffering in wearable formats. Additionally, electrochemical sensing platforms-particularly those based on sweat analysis-are presented as a non-invasive means to monitor key biochemical markers like lactate and electrolytes, providing actionable insights into performance and fatigue. Emphasis is placed on device architecture and fabrication strategies (including flexible substrates and printing techniques) that enhance wearability, durability, and real-time data capture. Beyond material design, emerging trends in machine learning are explored, showcasing how self-powered electrochemical systems can yield intelligent analytics for coaches and athletes alike. By merging electrochemical storage, energy harvesting, and data processing, these smart sports technologies promise to transform athletic training, competition, and injury prevention. Future prospects encompass multifunctional, integrated devices that leverage improved materials, manufacturing scalability, and AI-driven analysis for widespread deployment in sports performance monitoring.

TI Data visualizations for sports events prepared by fans. Communicative
   implications in the context of FIFA World Cup 2018
SO REVISTA VIRTUAL UNIVERSIDAD CATOLICA DEL NORTE
AB This article addresses the appropriation of data visualization technologies by fans of both technology and sports in the representation of massive sports events. This approach aims to identify particular aspects of this appropriation through a methodological analysis of features inscribed in the visual text. We studied three cases that took place in the 2018 FIFA World Cup with the perspective of visual text analysis. In the study, we took into account contextual dimensions such as the contemporary production of data visualization, the social differentiation between spectators and athletes, and the forms of validation of fanaticism in culture's framework. The results show the technological appropriation in the utterance around sport, the sense of sport inscribed in the interface, the construction of the receiver model, and the participation inside fan's community. Finally, conclusions ponder data visualizations made by fans as a parallel communicative mechanism, making up communal relationships, and that would give rise to the convergence of multiple anxieties beyond sports.

SO PROCEEDINGS OF THE INSTITUTION OF MECHANICAL ENGINEERS PART P-JOURNAL OF
   SPORTS ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY
AB The main aim of this work was to review the use of technological tracking methods to assess collective spatial-positioning variables in team sports. Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines and PICO design for systematic reviews, study identification was performed in four databases (PubMed, SPORTDiscus, ProQuest Central, and Web of Science). Articles were selected if they focused on player position and technological tracking methods. After duplicate removal, 2194 articles were identified based on the established search criteria, of which 72 articles were selected and analysed. Semi-automatic optic-based systems, Global Positioning System/Global Navigation Satellite Systems, and local positioning systems were used in 60%, 33% and 7% of the studies, respectively. All studies that measured tactical variables by local positioning system technology in team sports used local position measurement technology. Optic-based systems were used more often in the early years to analyse collective tactical behaviour during competition. Later, Global Positioning System/Global Navigation Satellite Systems became more frequent to measure behaviour in team sports during the training process. The possibility of using the same system during competition and training will facilitate the assessment of collective tactical behaviour in team sports.

AB This paper presents design work and empirical work, exploring a novel way of steering player behaviour and performance in sports, called 'coaxing'. We propose that athletic performance might be influenced by tricking players into thinking that their athletic abilities are different from what they really are. We approach this proposition from three different angles. First, we use related work to theoretically ground the concept of coaxing in literature. Second, we take a research-through-design approach to illustrate the potential of coaxing for sports practice, specifically volleyball. Third, we carried out an experimental study to shed light on the effectiveness of coaxing, also in the context of volleyball. For the experimental study, we explored the idea of coaxing by means of an augmented ball-catching task. For every participant, we quantified their ability to intercept fly balls and presented them with visualisations that either overstated or understated this ability; in the expectation that this would impact how they acted in the ball-catching task. While the effects of coaxing failed to reach significance, data suggest that coaxing might yet be a viable form of steering player behaviour. Contrary to our hypothesis, participants whose abilities had been understated mostly outperformed their counterparts. We discuss the particularities of the current findings and their implications for sports practice. We conclude with practical and theoretical recommendations to further develop the concept of coaxing.

Meantime, in the scientific training process, the analysis and comparison of technical movements' morphology are essential. And traditional motion analysis technology uses high-speed photography and video image analysis, which cannot accurately determine the action features, therefore cannot meet the needs of quantitative analysis and morphological analysis. In this paper, using the computer image processing and multimedia databases and other computer technology to do quantitative research on sports action characteristics, and establishing the motion feature model, all these will provide a scientific basis and action paradigm for sports teaching and training.

TI New Opportunities to Advance the Field of Sports Nutrition
SO FRONTIERS IN SPORTS AND ACTIVE LIVING
AB Sports nutrition is a relatively new discipline; with ~100 published papers/year in the 1990s to ~3,500+ papers/year today. Historically, sports nutrition research was primarily initiated by university-based exercise physiologists who developed new methodologies that could be impacted by nutrition interventions (e.g., carbohydrate/fat oxidation by whole body calorimetry and muscle glycogen by muscle biopsies). Application of these methods in seminal studies helped develop current sports nutrition guidelines as compiled in several expert consensus statements. Despite this wealth of knowledge, a limitation of the current evidence is the lack of appropriate intervention studies (e.g., randomized controlled clinical trials) in elite athlete populations that are ecologically valid (e.g., in real-life training and competition settings). Over the last decade, there has been an explosion of sports science technologies, methodologies, and innovations. Some of these recent advances are field-based, thus, providing the opportunity to accelerate the application of ecologically valid personalized sports nutrition interventions. Conversely, the acceleration of novel technologies and commercial solutions, especially in the field of biotechnology and software/app development, has far outstripped the scientific communities' ability to validate the effectiveness and utility of the vast majority of these new commercial technologies. This mini-review will highlight historical and present innovations with particular focus on technological innovations in sports nutrition that are expected to advance the field into the future. Indeed, the development and sharing of more "big data," integrating field-based measurements, resulting in more ecologically valid evidence for efficacy and personalized prescriptions, are all future key opportunities to further advance the field of sports nutrition.

TI Identifying Sports Diplomacy Resources as Soft Power Tools
SO PLACE BRANDING AND PUBLIC DIPLOMACY
AB Although hosting international high-profile sporting events such as the Olympics and the FIFA World Cup are attractive soft power tools for governments to achieve public diplomacy goals, not all sports diplomacy efforts are mega-sporting events. This study explores the use of sports diplomacy by nations and attempts to identify the most applicable sports diplomacy resources available to governments to employ as soft power tools. The data for this research are composed of 30 online surveys completed by international experts in the fields of sports and public diplomacy. The responses were qualitatively analyzed using the fuzzy Delphi method (FDM). After running two rounds of fuzzy Delphi, sports diplomacy resources were classified into three categories: "Sports Events," "Sports Human Capitals," and "Sports Products." Further, "sports players"; "women's sports"; "hosting/participating in regional, international, continental, or global events"; "coaches"; and "authentic sports leagues" were identified as the most important sports diplomacy resources.

TI Smartphone apps for orthopaedic sports medicine - a smart move?
SO BMC SPORTS SCIENCE MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION
AB Background: With the advent of smartphones together with their downloadable applications (apps), there is increasing opportunities for doctors, including orthopaedic sports surgeons, to integrate such technology into clinical practice. However, the clinical reliability of these medical apps remains questionable. We reviewed available apps themed specifically towards Orthopaedic Sports Medicine and related conditions and assessed the level of medical professional involvement in their design and content, along with a review of these apps.
   Method: The most popular smartphone app stores (Android, Apple, Blackberry, Windows, Samsung, Nokia) were searched for Orthopaedic Sports medicine themed apps, using the search terms; Orthopaedic Sports Medicine, Orthopaedics, Sports medicine, Knee Injury, Shoulder Injury, Anterior Cruciate Ligament Tear, Medial Collateral Ligament Tear, Rotator Cuff Tear, Meniscal Tear, Tennis Elbow. All English language apps related to orthopaedic sports medicine were included.
   Results: A total of 76 individual Orthopaedic Sports Medicine themed apps were identified. According to app store classifications, there were 45 (59 %) medical themed apps, 28 (37 %) health and fitness themed apps, 1 (1 %) business app, 1 (1 %) reference app and 1 (1 %) sports app. Forty-nine (64 %) apps were available for download free of charge. For those that charged access, the prices ranged from 0.69 pound to 69.99 pound. Only 51 % of sports medicine apps had customer satisfaction ratings and 39 % had named medical professional involvement in their development or content.
   Conclusions: We found the majority of Orthopaedic Sports Medicine apps had no named medical professional involvement, raising concerns over their content and evidence-base. We recommend increased regulation of such apps to improve the accountability of app content.

SO MATHEMATICAL PROBLEMS IN ENGINEERING
AB With the continuous development of society and the rapid development of science and technology, virtual reality technology is also developing rapidly. It has been widely used in all walks of life and is playing an irreplaceable role. Modern education has also begun to integrate with science. Sports are also constantly deepening the application of information technology. In order to make students have a new understanding of college physical education and sports training and improve the technical level and training quality of college sports athletes, this paper studies the application of virtual reality technology in physical education and sports training. In this paper, the semisupervised framework is used to implement motion input and interactive virtual scene algorithms. First, based on Q statistics, virtual simulation and differential selection algorithms are used to select athletic students with strong autonomous learning ability and then use the classifier's neighbor confidence. The formula selects the student with the highest learning level and marks it. Experimental results show that this method can effectively assist physical education activities and improve students' learning efficiency. Students' efficiency in sports has increased by 30%. At the same time, 2/3 of people believe that their interest in sports training has increased 80% and another 90% of college coaches believe that the use of virtual reality technology in physical education is very necessary, which can improve the technical level and training quality of college sports athletes and contribute to the reserve of Chinese competitive sports talents.

TI Kinanthropometric Attributes of Young Male Combat Sports Athletes
SO COLLEGIUM ANTROPOLOGICUM
AB Although there are enough studies concerning the kinanthropometric attributes of players of sports such as football, basketball, or volleyball in Turkey, there are not enough studies on the same for combat sports. Hence, our aim is to assess the kinanthropometric attributes of different combat sports like karate, taekwondo, judo and kickboxing. The present study included 48 national level male athletes from four different combat sports (age, 20.3 (3.19) years; number of years playing the sport, 8.33 (4.59); height, 174.3 (7.15) cm; weight, 67.35 (10.55 kg). Skinfold thickness was measured with a skinfold caliper (Holtain Ltd., UK), and Yuhazs formula was used to calculate the body fat percentage. Somatotype assessment was carried out with a computer program (Sweat Technology Trial Version, South Australia). Width measurements were obtained with a slide caliper (HLT-100, Holtain Ltd.), and girth measurements were obtained with a non-flexible tape measure. The data obtained were analyzed with the computer program SPSS 17.0 in terms of the SD. The findings were as follows: body mass index (BMI), 22.00 (2.66) kg/m(2); body fat percentage, 12.20% (3.07%); endomorphic component, 2.9 (1.30); mesomorphic component, 4.25 (1.30); and ectomorphic component, 3.10 (1.30). The cormic index was 51.99% (1.88%); Monourier index, 92.39% (4.47%); Acromio-iliac index, 60.87% (6.61%); Martine index, 6.29% (0.70%); Biacromial index, 22.58% (0.99%); and hip index, 13.91% (0.86%). The mesomorphic component was found to be dominant in our study. Although BMIs were found to be normal, body fat percentages were low. According to body proportions, the athletes who participated in this study had wide shoulders, narrow hips, and medium-sized trunks.

AB By means of research methods, including documents, online inquiry and logical reasoning, the thesis analyzes the current situations of Chinese sporting goods IPO enterprises and the opportunities and challenges they encounter when marching into ASEAN Trade Area. Then it can be concluded that Chinese sporting goods IPO enterprises are required to take full advantage of trade associations to vigorously conduct market researches, enlarge internal investments, pay ample attentions to avoid superfluous distribution and cutthroat competitions, implement "going-out" enterprise strategy, accelerate industrial upgrading and industrial transfer, increase investments in research and development, highlight brand marketing and strengthen enterprise competitiveness, providing component departments with sufficient evidence to make macro decisions.
   In January, 2010, with China-ASEAN Free Trade Area co-established by China and ten countries from ASEAN, all member countries are available to "zero-tariff" free trade, in other words, all countries within this area have gotten rid of their own "threshold" and products and capitals from these countries can be imported and exported free of barriers, which vitalizes ASEAN trade. In addition, with 1.7 billion costumers and a total trade volume of 1.23 trillion dollars, this free trade area proves to enjoy the largest population and area all over the world. With constant trade liberalization and broad cooperations in economy and technology, Chinese sporting goods enterprises will surely embrace precious opportunities and severe challenges. On one hand, abundant natural resources and cheap labor resources from ASEAN countries will bring Chinese sporting goods enterprises with considerable convenience and huge business opportunities to implement multinational capital, goods and labor service exchanges within the area. On the other hand, since Chinese sporting goods industry turns out to share more and more similarities with that of ASEAN countries in industrial structure and product mix, narrow complementary business spectrum exists. Besides sporting goods business accounts for a small proportion in the total volume of bilateral trade. Therefore it is imperative for Chinese sporting goods enterprises to figure out how to make the best of their own resources and advantages, reinforce complementariness of product mix and industrial trade with ASEAN and occupy the ASEAN market as soon as possible.

TI Long-distance sports
SO COMPUTERS IN SPORT
AB The merging of sports and computer technology has been mainly focused on supporting performance enhancement of professional athletes or, on the other end of the spectrum, simulating professional sports competitions for entertainment purposes in computer games. Less work has been undertaken on using computers to enhance social sports experiences. Long-Distance Sports is a novel approach using telecommunication technology in particular to enable geographically distant participants to enjoy a social sports experience together. The Long-Distance Sports presented here focus on physical exertion comparable to collocated sports, a shared experience although being geographically apart and social interaction between the players during casual sports play. Two systems are presented that have been tested by hundreds of players. Breakout for Two is a soccer-like game that uses distributed targets on a life-size videoconference to enable a sports experience between two players who each kick a real physical ball. Airhockey Over a Distance creates an increased sense of a shared space across the distance by having puck cannons shooting out real pucks on the remote end to enable a game of airhockey between geographically distant players. The results from these implementations indicate that Long-Distance Sports can be a valuable contribution to society by supporting interactions between players who are spending time apart in which they can achieve both a work-out and socializing.

AB For students, university duties could conflict with free time activities, these latter are often sacrificed. The purpose of this research is to know in what type of activities, including the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT), physical-sports activity and the consumption of cultural activities, most of the university students spend their free time from Monday to Friday, weekends and holidays. The population under research, consists of 1580 higher education students from the University of Guadalajara, Mexico, where 52.5% are women and 47.5% are men. Statistical data indicates that students dedicate most of their free time to the use of ICT's (passive leisure activities), mainly from Monday to Friday, while cultural consumption activities (social relationship and amusement activities) occur during weekends and holiday periods. It seems that physical and sports activities are not usually a priority for these students during their free time in the three time periods. Public policies need to be more responsive to the needs of young university students for free or leisure time. Otherwise, any public action or policy will lead to failure.

The information collected from such analysis is used to better understand the difficulties of trainees, players or even entire teams and formulate adequate training and strategic plans. Usually this evaluation is too self contained and does not explore the many tools there are available nowadays. This paper proposes a simulation tool to tackle this problem and establishes the bases for a Handball Sport Simulator. The simulator developed has its origins on the Soccer Server simulator used on the RoboCup competition and includes the main handball game rules and player actions. This paper establishes the ground foundations for a Handball Simulator and results show that the handball rules and actions can be modeled.

As Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology advances, its application in SFD offers both promising opportunities and significant challenges in areas such as curriculum design, evaluation, and participant engagement. Through a qualitative survey of experts and practitioners analysed through Thematic Analysis (TA), this paper explores perspectives on the potential of AI to enhance the delivery and management of SFD initiatives, as well as potential risks and needs in the field. Key perceived benefits include compensating for deficient organisational capacities and supporting the performance of both administrative and conceptual tasks. Potential risks include the propagation of increasingly generic approaches to SFD programming, loss of critical thinking skills, and concerns around participant safeguarding. To mediate this, exchange, education, and SFD-specific policies are seen as crucial.

TI Application of Ultrasound in Sports Injury
SO JOURNAL OF MEDICAL ULTRASOUND
AB The ability to make correct ultrasonographic diagnosis in sports injuries is improving as advancing technology allows for high-resolution images in contemporary medical ultrasound. Ultrasonography demonstrates tissue structure with two-dimensional grayscale images. Blood flow in the tissue can be rapidly depicted with color and power Doppler technique. Furthermore, ultrasonography is the preferred imaging modality to study soft tissue lesions dynamically. With high-resolution images afforded by ultrasonography, injuries of the muscle, tendon, ligament, bursa, bony structure, cartilage, and subcutaneous tissue can be accurately diagnosed if the examiner is well trained. A panoramic view makes the ultrasonographic images better understood by the sports clinicians. The advanced technique of sonoelastography examination, which facilitates understanding of stiffness in the soft tissue, is also a potential tool in diagnosis of sports injuries. Recently, compact ultrasound machine machines are becoming increasingly available, leading to prompt ultrasonographic diagnosis of sports injuries on the field. In this brief review, we will discuss common sports injuries of these structures, their clinical implications, and ultrasound key points.

AB The COVID-19 pandemic presents challenges to the provision of community programs and access to mental health services for young people. We examined the feasibility, reach, and acceptability of multi-technology delivery of an integrated system that assesses and provides feedback on youth mental health and wellbeing and connects them to care within the context of a youth sports development program. The system was delivered via computer, telephone, and teleconference with 66 adolescent boys participating in a rugby league development program in three communities in Australia. Young people completed online wellbeing and mental health measures (Assess step), parents were provided with telephone feedback on results, support, and referral options (Reflect step), and youth received teleconferenced workshops and online resources (Connect step). The multi-technology delivery was feasible to implement, and reach was high, with barriers experienced at the Assess step but minimally experienced at the Reflect and Connect steps. Delivering the system via multiple forms of technology was rated as highly beneficial and enjoyable by young people. Players improved in self-reported prosocial behaviour, gratitude, and anxiety symptoms from pre- to post-program. Strong collaboration between researchers, organisational personnel, and community members is important for achieving these outcomes.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH AND PUBLIC HEALTH
AB Blockchain technology provides a distributed support for information storage and traceability. Recently, it has been booming in a wide variety of domains: finance, food, energy, and health. In the field of physical activity, physical exercise, sport, and active ageing, this technology could also originate some interesting services introducing support for reliable repository of results, for gamification, or for secure data interchange. This systematic review explores the use of blockchain in this context. The objective is to determine to which extent this technology has fulfilled the potential of blockchain to bring these new added-value services. The authors explored 5 repositories in search of papers describing solutions applied to the above-mentioned frame. 17 papers were selected for full-text analysis, and they displayed diverse applications of blockchain, such as Fitness and healthcare, Sport, and Active ageing. A detailed analysis shows that the solutions found do not leverage all the possibilities of blockchain technology. Most of the solutions analyzed use blockchain for managing, sharing, and controlling access to data and do not exploit the possibilities of Smart Contracts or oracles. Additionally, the advantages of the blockchain model have not been fully exploited to engage users using approaches such as gamification.

TI Regulation of professional sport in a changing broadcasting environment:
   Australian club and sport broadcaster perspectives
SO SPORT MANAGEMENT REVIEW
AB Broadcasting is undergoing massive changes with technology introducing new delivery opportunities and thereby more broadcasters into the equation. Emerging technology in the sport broadcasting environment is complicated by the existing league and broadcasting regulations. League-based regulations impact on income distribution and product distribution, while broadcasting regulations, largely imposed by the elected Federal Government of the day, are enacted to ensure that commercial and public interests are being supported. Introducing a stakeholder interest-based approach, the regulation affecting professional sport clubs and broadcasters was examined in order to identify how they would respond to the regulation imposed on them in the emerging broadcasting environment.
   In depth interviewing of senior managers of Australian Football League (AFL) and National Rugby League (NRL) clubs as well as sport broadcasters was undertaken with the data analysed, and emergent themes recorded. Results indicate that league, broadcaster and. government regulations impact on the clubs and broadcasters in a variety of ways, with clubs facing regulation from the league and the broadcasters, while the broadcasters and league face regulation from the government legislation enacted. The results indicate that these organisations need to be aware of the conditions that arise from the existing and emerging broadcast regulatory environment in order to better understand and respond to it.

TI Is virtual reality head-mounted display accepted by coaches to enhance
   sport performance?
SO VIRTUAL REALITY
AB Virtual Reality Head-Mounted Display (VR-HMD) is increasingly being used as a tool to improve sport performance. Recent studies showed that VR-HMD is well accepted by athletes, before a first use, to improve their sport performance. But if athletes accept the VR-HMD but their coaches do not, there is a risk that the VR-HMD will never be used despite its benefits. Consequently, the aim of the present study was to assess coaches' acceptance of VR-HMD prior to first use, to highlight potential initial psychological blockages. The study sample included 239 French coaches training competitive athletes from different sports and different levels of competition (departmental-regional, national, international). Based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), coaches filled out a questionnaire assessing perceived usefulness of the VR-HMD for coaching, perceived usefulness for athletes, perceived ease of use, perceived enjoyment, job relevance, and intention to use. The results of the structural equation modelling highlighted that all the previous variables (except perceived ease of use) were positive predictors of coaches' intention to use the VR-HMD. The results of the one-sample t-tests showed that VR-HMD was well accepted by coaches before a first use, with scores of all the TAM variables significantly higher than the mean of the Likert scale for the full sample and for each level of competition (except for departmental-regional coaches). Before a first effective use, no issues of non-acceptance have been identified for the use of VR-HMD by coaches for sport performance optimization purposes.

TI Left Behind: Local Television and the Community of Sport
SO WESTERN JOURNAL OF COMMUNICATION
AB Changes in technology are causing significant shifts in the community of sport related to the mass media. This project uses both quantitative and qualitative data to reveal that local television stations are not engaged in sports blogging and see little value in it. This article discusses the theoretical and industry rationales regarding this finding, and details various implications for local sports media, sports communication consumers, and the community of sport in general. It may be that the traditional position of local sports television within that community is endangered, as technology makes sports more interactive, accessible, and global.

AB This paper, in the context of legacy preservation of green sport and its development, explores the connotation of green sport and problems presented in the aspect of consciousness, aiming at constructing a brand-new green sport theoretical pattern. Research indicates that the main theme of ecological sport in green Olympics is no longer confined to concrete environment control and ecological protection, and no longer to the competition between individuals. A collective belief is shaped together with a new thinking mode of sports development-harmony and development, of which focus is on coordination, compassion, coexistence, integration and mutual development of sport, culture and ecological environment. It is the unification of green body exercise, green community activity and green thinking pattern to essentially fulfill the greening of body exercise. Green sport demonstrates green consciousness of promise, be true in word and resolute in deed, and green global consciousness of universal ethics, and green consciousness of harmonious coexistence between human being and nature, and green voluntary consciousness of citizens status identification.

TI Gene therapy in sports medicine
SO SPORTS MEDICINE AND ARTHROSCOPY REVIEW
AB In sports injuries, the most commonly injured tissues, including cartilage, tendons, and certain ligaments, are limited in their ability to heal. A number of growth factors show promise as agents that may improve healing, but their potential clinical use is limited by delivery problems. Gene transfer technologies offer new ways to deliver growth factors and other useful products locally, in a sustained fashion, to tissues that have a restricted healing capacity. Gene transfer circumvents problems that result from the relatively short half-lives of the gene products and can be accomplished by in vivo and ex vivo procedures using a variety of different vector systems. Promising preliminary data have been published indicating the feasibility of transferring genes to bone, cartilage, ligament, and tendon. These data permit cautious optimism that gene therapy will be clinically used in the treatment of certain sporting injuries.

TI Sports Injury Surveillance Systems and Guidelines in Japan: A Systematic
   Review
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE
AB This systematic review aimed to identify sports injury surveillance systems (ISSs) and injury surveillance guidelines (ISGs) developed and currently used in Japan. Additionally, the extent to which ISSs and ISGs developed overseas are employed in Japan was also examined. A systematic search of electronic databases was performed in March 2021. Prospective studies that investigated sports injuries and targeted Japanese athletes or sports in Japan were included to identify the following: (1) details of the ISSs or ISGs developed among sports in Japan, and (2) characteristics of studies focusing on sports in Japan employing ISSs or ISGs developed overseas and the method of use. A total of five ISSs developed among sports in Japan were included, most of which were based on insurance benefits or condolence payment systems. In total, 23 studies used ISSs or ISGs developed overseas, more than half of which were used as a resource for the development of other data collection tools or methods, indicating that the definition of injury and/or classification of items are modified based on the needs among sports in Japan. This review highlights the necessity of establishing club-based or organisational ISSs and ISGs that are appropriate for sports in Japan.

TI Sports injuries patterns in children and adolescents according to their
   sports participation level, age and maturation
SO BMC SPORTS SCIENCE MEDICINE AND REHABILITATION
AB Background Growth can make young athletes more vulnerable to sports injuries. Increased knowledge about injury profile and its predictors is an important part of an overall risk management strategy but few studies have produced information. Methods Information about injury profile and sports participation (SP) level was obtained by LESADO and RAPIL II questionnaires. They were distributed to 651 participants aged between 10 and 18 years attending four schools. Maturity measures were evaluated through maturity offset (MO) and Tanner-Whitehouse III method. Bivariate analysis was used to identify the set of candidate predictors for multinomial logistic regression analysis that was used to determine significant predictors of injury type and body area injury location. Results Regarding injury type predictors recreative boys had more chances of having a sprain or a fracture than a strain. Also, recreative and scholar girls had more chances of having a sprain than a strain. As MO decreased, the chances of girls having a strain or a fracture when compared to sprains were higher. For body area location boys with 10-11 years were more likely to have upper limbs injuries than boys of other ages. This was also confirmed by MO. Spine and trunk injuries were more likely to occur in federate and no sports participation girls. Conclusions Injury type and body area injury location differed significantly by SP level, age group and MO.

AB The hiatus in stadium spectatorship due to the COVID-19 pandemic presents us with a unique opportunity to rethink the way sport fans participate in the making of live events. Some sport leagues have resumed, with others to follow, but the stadium experience has profoundly changed as fans cannot gather in the galleries until the spread of coronavirus is arrested. How can sport broadcasters continue to engage fans and mitigate the problem of the empty stadium? We argue that creative harnessing of user-generated content and integration of online and offline fandom can help broadcasters present sport in a much more attractive manner during and after the pandemic.

   sport: The performance analyst's perspective
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPORTS SCIENCE & COACHING
AB The study considered performance analysis and feedback from the perspective of the performance analyst through the investigation of the 'what', 'how' and 'when' of practice within a selection of Olympic sports. Twenty-three performance analysts (experience 6.4 +/- 4.1 years) engaged in a structured interview (85 +/- 15 min) regarding their processes within applied practice. Likert scales (All the time, Often, Sometimes, Rarely and Never) were used to facilitate cross-sport and environment comparison. The performance analysts highlighted the experience of their coaches as the most prominent feature influencing analysis direction, and time had the greatest impact upon feedback provision. The main analysis techniques used were video, profiling and performance reports. Feedback was delivered primarily either, (1) < 1-h post-performance within sessions lasting < 10-min or (2) the following day within sessions lasting 25 + min. Video feedback was usually coach led; however, data delivery was more evenly distributed between coach and analyst. Very similar processes across the participants were identified, despite a wide variety of sports and participant experience levels. The findings have begun to illustrate practice within elite sport whilst highlighting the importance and need for further practitioner-based investigation regarding the use of performance analysis and feedback within applied contexts.

An important contribution can be realised by greywater recycling in decentralised structures. This paper describes the results of a technical feasibility study to treat greywater with membrane technology in view of its reuse for applications which do not require potable water quality. A 3L-lab-scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) treating the shower effluent from a sports club in Rabat, Morocco, was operated with a hollow fibre membrane (Zeeweed, Zenon) for 137 consecutive days. Removal performance and membrane behaviour were assessed. The permeate was of excellent quality and complied with commonly proposed standards for domestic reuse except for bacteria] contamination. Non-detectable levels of faecal coliform could not be continuously guaranteed due to bacterial re-growth in the permeate pipe from the open permeate storage tank.

AB Technological development has a profound impact on all spheres of society, including sport. Sport organisations need to keep up with technological change and integrate innovations into their operations to improve performance. It is particularly important that sport managers are aware of the benefits of ICT and possess the necessary skills, since they are responsible for technology implementation in their organisations. Now that technology has permeated nearly all aspects of sport, there is a great need for research on the use of ICT among sport managers in order to understand their needs and address them accordingly. Therefore, the aim of this study was to determine the level, purposes, and patterns of ICT use in the management of sport organisations. An online survey was conducted with a sample of Croatian sport managers. In order to answer the research questions, descriptive statistics were calculated, exploratory factor analysis was performed, and Cronbach's alpha reliability coefficients were computed Respondents' answers suggest that the potential of ICT in the management of Croatian sports organisations is not fully exploited However, the surveyed managers believe that they themselves rely heavily on ICT in their work. According to the results, there are only a few areas in which the managers use ICT less frequently. In addition, factor analysis identified patterns of sport managers' ICT use by revealing three underlying dimensions. The first factor refers to the use of ICT for management and administration, the second factor to the use of ICT for finding information, and the third factor to the use of ICT for building relationships with stakeholders. The paper explored the issues that have been neglected and poorly addressed in the context of sport management. Despite some limitations, the study provides valuable information and directions for future research.

TI From fun to profession: the legitimation of e-sport as a sport in
   debate
SO REVISTA TECNOLOGIA E SOCIEDADE
AB In view of the growing evolution of electronic games and their relevance in the scenario of sports competitions, the importance of discussing the legitimacy of games known as e Sports as an authentic sports category becomes increasingly important. In this sense, the present work proposes to show the path taken by electronic games from its use as a kind of toy to the current context with its insertion in the contemporary sports modality of e Sports. It was also sought to emphasize the defense of labor rights that professional players would enjoy as a result of the legitimacy and regulation of e-Sports as a sport. For this, an extensive bibliographic survey was carried out and it was found that there is a solid base of economic data, reports and research that make this path possible. It could be verified that e-Sports have a wide range of characteristics that bring them closer to traditional sports categories and have conditions to be recognized as a contemporary sport. The new professions that emerged from the borders opened by the advancement of technology must be aligned with social rights, in order to value human dignity; health promotion and labor rights.

TI Knowledge Management in Botswana Sport: Current Status and Future
   Directions
SO PHYSICAL CULTURE AND SPORT STUDIES AND RESEARCH
AB In Botswana, sport is positioned as a potential driver of economic and social development. In particular, there are numerous discussions about increasing the socio-economic impact of sport and the need to professionalise Botswana sport. Knowledge Management (KM) can play a critical role in achieving this greater professionalisation and impact. Despite this importance, there have only been a small number of studies on KM in sports, and none of this literature explores the topic in sub-Saharan Africa. Against this background, the goals of our paper are two-fold. Firstly, we wish to map out the current knowledge management landscape in the Botswana sport sector. Secondly, we aim to propose concrete, evidence-based avenues to improve KM within the sector. This paper relies on findings generated through semi-structured qualitative interviews with individuals connected to Botswana sport. To allow for triangulation, these interviews are further supported by other, previous qualitative research as well as relevant academic and policy literature. The Knowledge Management framework from Sunassee and Sewry (2002) is used to analyse and structure the results. Overall, we see that KM in Botswana sport is somewhat present at the individual, organisational level, but numerous obstacles and inefficiencies exist in creating and sharing knowledge at the sectoral level. To support the growth of KM in the sector, numerous concrete recommendations are presented. In particular, we highlight a need to communicate the value of KM better and obtain the necessary buy-in.

TI How Canadian High-Performance Coaches Adopt and Implement Technology:
   Exploring the Antecedents of Intra- and Interorganizational Trust,
   Technological Proficiency, and Subjective Norms and Social Influence on
   Technology Adoption
SO INTERNATIONAL SPORT COACHING JOURNAL
AB Technological innovation has been shown to make meaningful impacts across several aspects of high-performance sport. Although the literature on technology adoption and implementation is vast, currently very little exists on the coach's perspective in this regard. This investigation explored Canadian high-performance sport coaches and their relationship with technology adoption. Eleven coaches from both summer and winter National Sport Organizations were interviewed using a semistructured format. Three thematic categories were identified. First, intra-and interorganizational trust showed that coaches valued being aware and informed of any planned changes, and that educating them on technology adoption was important for gaining their participation. Second, coaches mentioned that they took the time to search for and build a fully functional technology, and valued collaboration among their peers for sharing technology-based knowledge. Finally, many of these high-performance coaches also depended upon their relationships to mentor coaches or other coaches in the field to identify and apply new technology. The outcome of this research may provide insight into shaping future policies to help sport coaches get access to the technology that more directly meets their needs.

TI The Global Business of Sport in a Brave New World: Conceptualising a
   Framework for Alternative Futures
SO FRONTIERS IN SPORTS AND ACTIVE LIVING
AB In July 1991, Sports Illustrated published a special issue featuring two articles that prognosticated about what sport would look like 10 years later. As the world entered the 21st century, Sports Illustrated writers, Oscar Johnson and Ron Fimrite, offered their visions of sport in the year 2001. Their analysis highlighted how a range of economic, social and technological changes in society would impact on how sport is structured, produced and consumed, but also offered insights into the future of the major professional sport leagues in North America. It has been 30 years since they publicised their views and, while technology continues to impact sport, the Covid-19 pandemic has forced the world to pause and to consider a range of deep, soul-searching questions about the nature of society, including sport. Against this background, we consider the opportunities and challenges for sport in the 21st century. The paper is divided into three sections including: (1) a reflection on the meaning, value and significance of sport including its privileged position in society, or what we refer to as "sporting exceptionalism"; (2) a brief overview of a case study that illustrates the challenges facing the global business of sport; and, (3) a framework for conceptualising alternative futures in the global business of sport, drawing on examples from women's sport.

TI The state-of-the-art in sport tourism geographies
SO TOURISM GEOGRAPHIES
AB The geography of sport offers valuable theoretical and conceptual frames to inform the study of sport-related tourism. While all sports share fundamental aspects such as rule structures, elements of competition and aspects of physical play, the manifestations of these dimensions of sport are enormously diverse. Sport and tourism are socially constructed phenomena. The constant evolution of sports in different societies raise a spectacular array of opportunities - and challenges - for tourism development. This review paper explores the development of the field of sport tourism over time, tracing the academic study of sport tourism to two seminal pieces of work that were published in 1989. It reviews current and emerging avenues of research in this dynamic field, highlighting gaps in the literature that focus particularly on the environmental and technological dimensions of sport tourism. We conclude that the social, economic, technological and political forces of change in our societies will continue to reshape (and be reshaped by) the geographies of sport and tourism.

TI Biological Fandom: Our Changing Relationship to Sport and the Bodies We
   Watch
SO COMMUNICATION & SPORT
AB In the last few decades, our exposure to sport has increased dramatically through advancements in television, Internet, and mobile technologies. This rise in exposure and accessibility has increased biological knowledge among sport "fans,'' a concept I use broadly, and complicated our relationship with sport. Using Rose's notion of biological citizenship, which draws on Foucault's concepts of biopolitics and bio-power, I introduce "biological fandom'' as a way to think about the intensification of bioknowledge in and around sport. As a problem space where various relationships of power intersect, biofandom creates new forms of knowledge, surveillance, and ethical problems. In this article, I sketch the relations of power that create biological fandom. First, I focus on aspects of the media that are concerned with quantifying the bodies of athletes and new biomedical treatments in sports medicine. Second, within this larger media context, I proceed to explore what I see as a particularly concentrated manifestation of biofandom, fantasy sports. Using examples from fantasy sports media, I argue that biological fandom perpetuates neoliberal norms that encourage self-work and individualism among "biofans,'' while also fetishizing the individual athlete and creating undifferentiated athletic masses.

SO SUSTAINABILITY
AB The advanced technology of virtual reality (VR) has brought about significant changes in our society, and leisure sports are no exception. The purpose of this study was to assess how leisure satisfaction with leisure sports and degree of sustainable participation affect men and women in actual sports and virtual reality (VR) sports. Exploratory factor analysis was applied to confirm scale validity and reliability, and multivariate analysis of variance and multiple regression were conducted for comparative analysis and linear relationships between variances. The results showed that while men typically participate in masculine' sports and women in feminine' sports, both genders equally enjoy the same types of VR sports. In terms of gender differences, female VR sport participants placed importance on educational leisure satisfaction and the intent of sustainable participation. Interestingly, there were no significant differences in the physical, psychological, or social leisure satisfaction factors, indicating no differences in satisfaction between performing actual sports and those in the VR environment. In addition, all factors except relaxation factor, had a positive impact on intent of sustainable participation. This study implied that VR sports offer an opportunity for people to be together, regardless of gender, and that it is becoming a part of healthy leisure sports culture.

SO TECHNOLOGICAL FORECASTING AND SOCIAL CHANGE
AB This study adds to our understanding of the role that information and communication technologies play in facilitating social connections between sports fans and the organizations that cater to them. We examine the features that encourage frequent IT-mediated social interactions among fans, which in turn increases fan engagement. Participation at a high level is essential for effective knowledge dissemination through digital media and social networks. The current research uses UCINET 6 to analyse focus group network data. Nine specialists, including five marketing academics and four sports fans, were convened to explore the relationship between the influencing factors. On average, the panellists were 32 years old, and they had been avid sports viewers for at least seven years. Based on the findings, digital interventions are being implemented to improve some crucial characteristics that affect fan engagement in the sports business. Interaction, identification, and interface were found to be the most important elements to support effective digital social engagement and information sharing in the sports ecosystem. This study adds new insight to our understanding of the brand consumer-consumer-brand triad in an IT-mediated sports communication network.

SO EKONOMIA I PRAWO-ECONOMICS AND LAW
AB Motivation: Globalisation is not only about the mobility of capital and proliferation of global problems. It is also about common approaches in public governance. Modern technologies help to disseminate information on sport as well as raise interests and encourage citizens to engage in sport. Globalisation has made it easier. There is no need to travel-Olympic Games, football matches and various other sports can be watched on TV, with broadcasts offering more insights than live watching on the spot. Globalisation, however, is also seen in various public or grass-root initiatives which, by addressing existing inequalities, support certain groups i.e. women or minorities to help them achieve more equal position in sport.
   Aim: The papers aim is to analyse the impact of globalisation (use of modern, digital technologies) on public governance in sport based on the example of Poland. Poland is specific because there exists a strong gender bias and unequal involvement of men and women in professional sport. It translates into financial support. All of the above aspects will be scrutinized.
   Results: The analyses will be based on the available public data on the financing of professional sport as well as achievements in the Olympic Games between the years 1924 and 2016. Moreover, some light will be shed on media coverage of sports events. The applied research methods include a critical literature review and analyses of gathered statistical data. The paper fills in the gap in the existing literature where impact of globalisation on sport in terms of public governance and gender imbalance is not often discussed.

This paper critically investigates elite sports' possible future in a world where cutbacks in resource use, pollution, and greenhouse gas emission are indispensable measures towards environmental sustainability. Research methods The paper is a conceptual and pragmatic inquiry that uses the current research literature to explore the logics of elite sport and its dynamics and alignment with paradigms of sustainability. Results and findings Elite sport's extensive engagement with governments and commercial agents pursuing prestige, growth, and profit has created a current state of overheating and runaway processes that threatens both sport's internal values and nature itself. The situation begs extending the self-imposed constraints in sports practice to the governance of sport in a way that is fully compatible with elite sport. Implications Provided concrete sustainability reforms are substantiated, on the innovation of equipment and technology, on state and commercial financing of elite sport, and on the organizing of competitions and mega-events, elite sport can flourish as a healthier and environmentally friendly social activity.

TI Application of Deep Convolution Network Algorithm in Sports Video Hot
   Spot Detection
SO FRONTIERS IN NEUROROBOTICS
AB Sports videos are blowing up over the internet with enriching material life and the higher pursuit of spiritual life of people. Thus, automatically identifying and detecting helpful information from videos have arisen as a relatively novel research direction. Accordingly, the present work proposes a Human Pose Estimation (HPE) model to automatically classify sports videos and detect hot spots in videos to solve the deficiency of traditional algorithms. Firstly, Deep Learning (DL) is introduced. Then, amounts of human motion features are extracted by the Region Proposal Network (RPN). Next, an HPE model is implemented based on Deep Convolutional Neural Network (DCNN). Finally, the HPE model is applied to motion recognition and video classification in sports videos. The research findings corroborate that an effective and accurate HPE model can be implemented using the DCNN to recognize and classify videos effectively. Meanwhile, Big Data Technology (BDT) is applied to count the playing amounts of various sports videos.

AB Auxetic materials offer potential to be applied to sports safety equipment. This work reports quasi-static and impact testing of auxetic open-cell polyurethane foam - fabricated with a compression and heat treatment process - in comparison to its conventional counterpart. The foam was compressed to 70% of its original dimension along each dimension during the conversion process. Quasi-static compression testing confirmed the converted foam to be auxetic, with a Poisson's ratio of -0.08. Impact testing was performed for energies up to 5.6 J with an instrumented drop rig and high-speed video. Peak accelerations were similar to 3 times lower for the auxetic foams, because they prevented bottoming. This work has shown further potential for auxetic foam to be applied to sports safety devices. Future work should look to optimise foam selection and the conversion process, while comparing auxetic foam with existing materials and products. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.

SO TELEVISION & NEW MEDIA
AB The interacting social forces that have shaped the development of the electronic media constitute complex and contrary developments. Television technology, unlike that of the cinema, took a long time to grow from a technological possibility in the 1930s to maturation in the 1970s. Mega-events such as the Olympic Games and the World Cup have both a centripetal and a centrifugal character. They suck in global attention in a vortextual fashion, and yet the spectacle is not so much local and embedded as it is dispersed around the globe. Live sport, dispersed across platforms, is part of a bifurcation of social lifepeople are half present and embedded, half engaged in virtual interactivity. Technology has typically developed in two directionsproducing the giant screens of public viewing spaces and also of the living room, and producing the miniaturization that enables live sport on mobiles, watches, and the Google Glass. Finally, media sport is ubiquitous yet is all but invisible to many others who simply filter it out.

TI The knee in elite sports
SO ARTHROSKOPIE
AB The knee joint is one of the most frequently injured body regions in many sports. Particularly in elite sports, knee injuries are often severe injuries accounting for long periods of absence from several weeks to months and significantly influencing the athlete's career. In addition to the acute injury the high risk of recurrent injuries and long-term effects as well as secondary injuries and a continuing high impact on the knee joint play an important role in elite sports. A better understanding of the injury circumstances and identification of risk factors are therefore crucial to improve primary prevention strategies. Furthermore, a comprehensive understanding of the structural damage occurring after an injury is also necessary to continually optimize therapeutic interventions. The rapid development of technology in recent years has considerably contributed to a better understanding of the total amount of knee injuries and their origin. Due to the rapid improvement of novel therapeutic and particularly surgical procedures, medicine is increasingly succeeding in helping elite athletes to regain their previous performance level even in the case of complex injuries; nevertheless, professional and elite athletes require individually adapted treatment options and rehabilitation measures in order to ensure a rapid return to sport.

TI The assessment of sports performance by grip pressure using flexible
   piezoresistive pressure sensors in seven sports events
SO SCIENTIFIC REPORTS
AB Flexible micro-sensors have significant application potential in the field of sports performance evaluation. The aim of this study is to assess sports performance by grip pressure using a MMSS sensor (MXene as the sensitive material and melamine sponge as the substrate, a type of flexible piezoresistive pressure sensor). The grip pressures of expert and amateur players are evaluated in single skills events (golf, billiards, basketball, javelin and shot put) and in skills conversion (badminton and tennis). Indicators (time nodes, intervals, peaks, etc.) related to grip pressure on the handle are collected, analyzed, and identified by artificial intelligence. Finally, the K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) of artificial intelligence algorithms is employed to identify differences for 400 strokes of tennis players in interval training session. Expert tennis athlete exhibits a higher level of precision, concentration and stability for exert and release of grip force (KNN accuracy of train 95.0%) than amateur (KNN: 84.6%) during single movement, technical conversion, and interval training condition. This research offers a new perspective for evaluating sports performance in hand-held equipment events and presents a feasible direction for facing challenges of flexible wearable technology in practice.

SO JOURNAL OF SPORT MANAGEMENT
AB The advancement of augmented reality (AR) technology is significantly altering the way of sport spectatorship. The current study explored how diverse consumer groups adapt and escalate their experiences in AR spectatorship by integrating the dual-process theory of habituation, and sensitization and selective attention processes. The authors analyzed NFL matches with AR features by between-subject experimental study. Results indicated that the highly involved group experienced habituation by watching a prolonged AR highlight, while the lowly involved group experienced sensitization by watching both prolonged and brief AR highlights. The study contributes to the media technology and consumer behavior literature by exploring the visual sensory system that causes different responses between user groups. The results also provide an effective guideline to managers by suggesting an important reference for an optimal level of AR exposure duration.

TI Systems factorial technology provides novel insights into the cognitive
   processing characteristics of open-skill athletes
SO PSYCHOLOGY OF SPORT AND EXERCISE
AB Sport expertise has been shown to modulate the cognitive advantage in open-skill athletes, with evidence for a greater advantage for athletes practicing interceptive sports relative to strategic sports. However, this conclusion is solely based on central tendency measures such as accuracy or mean reaction time (RT), dismissing important information embedded in the intra-individual temporal dynamics of cognitive performance. This study aimed to better understand the cognitive advantage associated with open-skill sports, with a non-parametric approach assessing cognitive process at the level of RT distribution (i.e., systems factorial technology, SFT). Twenty-eight interceptive sport athletes, 27 strategic sport athletes, and 26 physically active non-athletes performed a go/nogo version of the redundant target task to assess their processing capacity of simultaneously monitoring multiple information channels. SFT was applied to assess resilience capacity, an estimate of workload capacity underlying inhibitory control. Our findings showed that interceptive sport athletes exhibited shorter mean RT relative to non-athletes selectively in the task condition involving distracting information, while strategic sport athletes showed greater resilience capacity over earlier responses relative to the other groups. These findings suggest that the two types of open-skill sports may be associated with different processing specificity, possibly reflecting the domain-specific rules and requirements.

SO JOURNAL OF RESEARCH IN INTERACTIVE MARKETING
AB Purpose The purpose of this study is to determine which factors affect virtual reality (VR) adoption by sports fans. Second, this paper seeks to evaluate consumer expectations of experience as related to introduction of VR. Based on the technology acceptance model, modified for the purpose of this study, and expectancy value theory, it was hypothesized that the frequency of sports-related information consumption, via different media channels, the expected improvement in the consumption of sports related information after adoption and attitude toward VR positively affect the likelihood of adoption.
   Design/methodology/approach The study relied on a quantitative questionnaire design method embedded in Qualtrics online survey tool. In addition, participants were exposed to a 75-s video about VR.
   Findings This study found that attitude toward VR, frequency of sports-related information consumption and expected improvements to information consumption after technology introduction positively affect adoption. The findings encourage adoption of a new channel, as it is likely to improve sports fan experiences related to information seeking and sports service consumption.
   Originality/value This study attempted to explore a relatively untapped area of research in VR usage particularly focusing on sports consumers. Most importantly, this applied study explored whether fans are willing to adopt VR, a relatively new technology that may have a high impact on the sports industry. Finally, this study relied on the modified technology adoption model and attempted to minimize its shortcomings. With that, this study should be viewed as beneficial to both theory and practice.

AB This chapter introduces the development of sport sociology in Japan especially focusing on the activities of the Japanese Society of Sport Sociology (JSSS) and research by members of the society. Following a brief history, we discuss some notable and influential research in Japanese sport sociology. Then we pick up the two areas of Olympic Studies and Sport for Development and Peace to show the current situation of sport sociology in Japan. In Japan, the development of sport sociology and sport itself are tightly linked with the development of the society as a whole, especially influenced by economic factors. In regards to the future of sport sociology as well as sport, we believe that this will depend on the economic situation, although sport-related persons (except for sociologists) tend to expect much of the governmental body. Because the volume of Olympic Studies and Sport for Development and Peace research is increasing, sport sociology will achieve a certain amount of success by the 2020 Tokyo Olympics/Paralympics. However, we need to seek a way to maintain the momentum of sport sociology in Japan after the year 2020.

AB In the information age, "mobile Internet," "cloud computing," "Internet of Things," and "data mining" concepts are emerging at the same time, as well as other fields of related data-based applications. The mobile application will be born as a result. Therefore, in the information age, big data, which involves information in a specific key or specialized field, has gradually begun to receive a lot of attention in recent years. In 2011, the US consulting firm McKinsey and Company first proposed the arrival of the "era of big data" and in August 2015 in China's State Council issued a notice of action outline "to promote the development of big data." Meanwhile, big data has gradually become an important factor in driving national reform and innovation, promoting scientific and technological progress, improving the way society is managed, and guiding changes in education and research. Big data is driving a very influential shift in thinking in an era where big data is changing the way we live, becoming the way we understand the world, and gradually becoming the source of new inventions and services. At the same time, the rapid development of big data technology for physical education teachers needs big data for management and training and other institutional managers to provide more effective ways and means of education management, but up to now, the status of big data for management is still another serious challenge, sports and training and other institutions of big data and processing process of data nonintelligent, nonclosed-loop processing, data nonlinked processing, etc. Many problems are also still very obvious.

In this paper, we combine the characteristics of "big data" and the construction of teachers in sports training institutions, and put forward some suggestions on how to improve the level of teachers in sports training institutions in the era of big data and conclude that the construction of teachers in sports training institutions should seize the key era now and enter the "|big data era." We conclude that the construction of teachers in sports training institutions should seize the critical era and enter the "big data era," so as to rely on science and technology to improve the construction system of teachers in sports training institutions.

TI The Use of Global Positioning Systems Devices to Measure Maximum
   Velocity in Field-Based Team Sport Athletes: A Narrative Review
SO STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING JOURNAL
AB The maximum velocity achieved during sprinting is a crucial aspect in various sports. Therefore, practitioners use various devices, such as laser or radar guns, timing gates (TG), and global positioning systems (GPS), to assess sprint performance. Although high-speed cameras are considered the most accurate equipment for assessing maximum velocity (Vmax), TG are more commonly used because of their practicality and affordability. Recently, GPS technology has gained attention from the sport science community, primarily because of its applied characteristics, enabling "in situ" data exploration. However, there is currently no consensus on the validity, reliability, and sensitivity of GPS in field-based team sports not only for measuring Vmax but also for tracking potential changes in sprint performance. We thoroughly examined the existing literature on the validity, reliability, and sensitivity of GPS technology for measuring Vmax, with a specific emphasis on its application in team sports. Furthermore, we offer a comprehensive discussion on the capability of these devices to assess potential variations in Vmax. By synthesizing current research findings, this narrative review sheds light on the strengths and limitations of GPS devices for assessing Vmax in field-based team sport athletes.

TI The Effects of Consumer Innovativeness on Sport Team Applications
   Acceptance and Usage
SO JOURNAL OF SPORT MANAGEMENT
AB The purpose of this study is to investigate the effects of consumer innovativeness on sport fans' behavioral intention to adopt and use sport team apps. Combining the diffusion theory with the technology acceptance model, the current study proposed three extended technology acceptance models. The proposed models were tested with data collected from 233 sport team apps users in the United States. The findings indicate that consumer innovativeness has direct and indirect influences on behavioral intention through beliefs about sport team apps. The partially mediated model fits the data well, was more parsimonious, and had a greater proportion of the variance explained by intention than the other models and thus was chosen for further analysis. Consumer innovativeness and beliefs about the apps explained 55.4% and 42% of the variance in intention to adopt sport team apps, respectively. Empirical evidence also provides strong support for the integrative approach. The study suggests an extended model of technology acceptance model for the acceptance and use of the sport team apps, which can help scholars and marketers understand sport fans' media behaviors.

TI Online training of sports coaches: bibliographic review
SO APUNTS EDUCACION FISICA Y DEPORTES
AB The current situation created by the global COVID-19 pandemic has put distance learning to the test at an unprecedented scale. The purpose of this study was to review the existing literature on online education of sports coaches carried out by official institutions (public bodies, federations, universities) and unofficial institutions (foundations, service companies and other educational organisations) through a systematic search of various databases. Data on study design, participants, variables, instruments, and results were extracted. After a selective search of the articles, the PRISMA checklist was used to select suitable articles for subsequent analysis and evaluation, which was carried out using the modified version of the Downs & Black checklist (1998). Fourteen descriptive and review studies were analysed for the coaches online learning preferences, its functionality and the applicable improvements. The analysis of the content of the articles allowed the identification of four main lines of research: description of the technological and computer tools available to the coaches, examination of the coaches' preferences, analysis of the use of resources by the coaches, and evaluation of the effectiveness of existing resources. The analysis of all of them allowed us to conclude that online learning is an extremely useful resource for the education of coaches, due to its advantages over traditional learning, despite some limitations such as the absence of physical interaction.

SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPORTS MARKETING & SPONSORSHIP
AB PurposeThis study empirically tests the Artificially Intelligent Device Use Acceptance Model in the context of sports services.Design/methodology/approachThe model was tested using partial least squares structural equation modeling on data from 105 users.FindingsWe found that emotions towards artificially intelligence (AI)-supported devices predict the intention to use these devices but not objection behavior. Consumers' appraisal of AI anthropomorphism does not significantly impact performance or effort expectancies.Research limitations/implicationsThe main limitation is the relatively small sample size. The tested model is partially validated, and we identify new variables to extend the model. We contribute to the controversial literature on using AI to replace human agents in service delivery.Practical implicationsThis research aids organizations in refining their investment and diffusion strategies for AI-supported devices.Originality/valueThese findings extend the literature by validating an AI-specific theoretical model for sports services, providing insights for enhancing AI-supported device adoption strategies.

TI Relationship between transformational leadership and positive youth
   development in Japanese sports
SO FRONTIERS IN SPORTS AND ACTIVE LIVING
AB Introduction: This study examined the relationship between transformational leadership (TFL) behaviors of coaches and positive youth development (PYD) outcomes in Japanese youth sports settings. Research has shown associations between TFL and various athlete outcomes in Western sports contexts. However, limited attention has been paid to how cultural factors shape these relationships in East Asian settings, particularly within Japanese sports culture that emphasizes hierarchical relationships and collectivist values. Methods: The study included 112 first-year undergraduate students from a sports science program at a Japanese university. Athletes' perceptions of their coaches' TFL behaviors and PYD outcomes were assessed using the Differentiated Transformational Leadership Inventory for Youth Sport (DTLI-YS) and the Youth Experience Survey for Sport (YES-S). Results: Correlation analyses revealed a particularly strong association between high performance expectations and initiative (r = .53, p < .01), notable when compared to American research where correlations between PYD outcomes and TFL dimensions were typically weaker (r = .11 - .43). Regression analyses further showed that high performance expectations were significantly associated with both goal setting (beta = .29, p < .05) and initiative (beta = .39, p < .01). Analysis by competition level revealed significant differences in initiative (F = 4.07, p < .01, eta(2) = .10) and total YES-S scores (F = 2.75, p < .05, eta(2) = .07). Discussion: These findings contribute to understanding how cultural context shapes the relationship between coaching leadership and youth development in sports. While the prominence of high performance expectations reflects Japanese sports culture's emphasis on discipline and collective achievement, results suggest the importance of incorporating a more balanced leadership approach that includes elements beyond high performance expectations to foster comprehensive athlete development.

In this paper, the main study of modern biology and nanotechnology on the impact of competitive sports. In this paper, eight boys were randomly divided into two groups, one group wore the swimsuit made of nanofiber materials, the other group wore the swimsuit made of common clothing materials for three swimming competitions. The experiment found that in the first competition, the results of the Nano group were mostly higher than the ordinary swimsuit group. Only the No. 3 player in the Nano group scored 9.23 s, which was lower than the 8.99 s of the No. 3 player in the ordinary group. In the second competition, the performance of the Nano group is still higher than that of the ordinary group, except that the No. 2 player in the Nano group has a score of 10.22 s. In the third time, the four members of the frontier Nano group achieved higher scores than the ordinary group. The No. 3 player in the ordinary group had a large error in the results, which was not meaningful.According to the results of the three competitions, under the control of variable factors, the results of nano group are much better than those of ordinary group. The results show that nanotechnology and modern biotechnology can effectively reduce the unnecessary energy consumption of athletes in the competition, save the competition time, and bring new vitality to competitive sports.

AB That motor sport is synonymous with advanced manufacturing is probably true of the upper echelons such as F1, WRC and ALMS. However, at privateer level, many of the advanced manufacturing technologies, and to an extent many of the more traditional manufacturing technologies, are beyond reach due to a combination of cost and low production volumes. One technology that has the potential to make the transition from the upper echelons to the privateer level is rapid casting technology. Rapid casting combines the advantages of traditional casting, including greater flexibility during the design stage and a more effective structural behaviour, with the requirement for low production numbers synonymous with motor sport. The low-volume element is achieved through the use of rapid prototyping technology to fabricate the high quality and complex patterns used in investment casting with lower cost and shorter leading times. A potential application was investigated through the presented case study. This involved the use of rapid casting, based on the direct rapid prototyping approach, to design and manufacture an upright for a single-seater race car. The use of advanced computer-aided design/computer-aided manufacture techniques and rapid casting technology resulted in an upright that is structurally efficient (<160MPa main load cases), has low weight (approximate to 900g) and a reduced number of component parts.

   STUDIES
AB The aim of this research is to make evaluation about sporting editors' attribute at daily newspapers to victory and defeat, success and failure at football matches. Two of 5 newspapers, which have a reputation all around Turkey and have more than 100.000 circulations were randomly selected. The two newspapers which have been selected for their articles of sporting editors to be analyzed are Hurriyet and Sabah. In this figurative research, the news published during 2010 January, February and March in Hurriyet and Sabah have been scanned. Total of 365 (196 from Hurriyet, 169 from Sabah) critique have been accumulated, analyzed and evaluated. During the research, sporting editors' assessments about victory and defeat, success and failure have been classified with statistical method. As a result of this classification, effects of match results on sporting editors' opinions and articles have been evaluated by the analysis. The findings, which have been acquired, show that sporting editors attribute victory of football teams to internal reasons and attribute defeats to external reasons. Furthermore, they are only interested in results. The educational discipline of sport-press employees is significant to generate a conscious public opinion. Studies and plans needs to be constituted in this direction.

TI SPORTS INDUSTRY MEETS ACADEMIA: THE PEDAGOGICAL DEVELOPMENT OF AN MS
   DEGREE PROGRAM IN SPORTS PRODUCT DESIGN
SO TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION
AB In the U.S., Portland, Oregon, is home to the sports product design industry. Jobs in this industry vary from entry-level retail assistants to CEOs, but the heart of it all revolves around designers and the inventive products they create. Becoming a successful designer can be very challenging and competitive, as undergraduate design and engineering programs in the U.S. provide basic skills but not industry-specific skills that fully allow designers to succeed in all divisions (apparel, footwear, and equipment) of the sports product industry. The University of Oregon, through a strategic initiatives effort, identified this opportunity and developed an integrative Master of Science graduate degree program in Sports Product Design. The program was created to include specialized courses from the departments of human physiology, journalism, business, and design to develop graduates proficient in using theories and creative problem solving skills to invent products that push the boundaries of athletic performance. Students learn how design can reduce athletic injuries and extend careers, improve performance, and address issues related to gender and diverse body types, including athletes with disabilities. This paper will review the creation of this one-of-a-kind program in the U.S., including pedagogical considerations, curriculum, and student inventions over the last three years.

TI Textbook journalism? Objectivity, education and the professionalization
   of sports reporting
SO JOURNALISM
AB In this article, we present an analysis of recent handbooks, field guides and other educative texts on sports journalism. Authored mostly by current and former journalists turned university educators, these books signal the professionalization of sports journalism amid changes and challenges to news media industries. In offering guidance on best practice sports reporting, they are also situated in tension with the long-standing denigration of sports journalism as the trivial back-page filler that props up more serious, substantive content. Through a thematic analysis of the textbooks' contents and the epistemic, economic and educative context of their collective emergence, we address the following question in what follows: How do these textbooks advise would-be sports journalists to respond to 'serious' social, ethical and political matters? In doing so, we detail how established categories of objectivity and ethics are the primary points of recourse through which these books advise on reporting about the many social issues in which sport is implicated. In turn, we reflect on the virtues of - and the tensions and contradictions surrounding - these advocations. By way of conclusion, we contend that professionalization represents an opportunity for collaborations between sport media scholars and current and former journalists - in their shared roles as educators - in the pursuit of 'excellent' sports reporting. The notion of 'strong objectivity' is our conceptual guide for how such collaborations might be fostered.

TI Video assistant referees (VAR): The impact of technology on decision
   making in association football referees
SO JOURNAL OF SPORTS SCIENCES
AB The use of technology has been proposed to improve decision-making in sport officials. The implementation of the video Assistant Referee (VAR) in association football is one example of how technology can be used to assist decision making, although its impact remains unknown. In 2195 competitive football matches across 13 countries, the VAR conducted 9732 checks for potential match-changing incidents, with the median duration of a check being 22 seconds. The checks resulted in a total of 795 reviews, with a median duration of 62.0 s for on-field reviews (N= 534) and 15.0 s for VAR-only reviews (N= 261).We report that the predictive odds for making the correct decision after VAR intervention were significantly higher than for the initial referee's decision, with accuracy increasing from 92.1% to 98.3%. Findings have implications for the current debate about the introduction of technology in association football and may help set guidelines regarding the use of technology across other sports and professional domains.

TI Sports Injury Rehabilitation Intervention Algorithm Based on Visual
   Analysis Technology
SO MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS
AB Sports injuries of high-level athletes restrict the improvement of sports performance. Under this premise, an efficient and accurate sports injury assessment method is needed to detect potential sports injuries and conduct injury prevention training. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel sports injury prediction algorithm based on visual analysis technology. The proposed algorithm first takes the time-frequency of sensed data as the convolutional neural network (CNN) input. The one-dimensional time series collected by the sensor is converted into two-dimensional images using the Gram angle domain algorithm. The one-dimensional sensed data provides a new perspective and provides a basis for better use of convolutional neural networks and computer vision technology. Second, combining the residual network's structure and advantages and hole convolution and multihole convolution kernel residual module is proposed. It improves the model's ability to extract features at different scales while effectively controlling the parameter scale. Based on these modules, a single-sensor-based athlete action recognition algorithm is proposed. Several comparative experiments have been conducted on a public data set containing only acceleration sensors to verify the proposed algorithm's effectiveness.

AB Physical education has a very important role in the development process of the young generation but also in the preservation of the population's health condition. To achieve these benefits, one of the most important aspects regarding physical education classes is the constant concern of PE teachers for developing the students necessary skills and abilities for the independent practice of various forms of physical activity throughout their lives and increasing the number of hours allocated to sports. For students, everything that has to do with technology, (smartphones, smart-watches etc.) has become a must have. This also applies in the sport area. While using technology, people can monitor their heart rate, number of steps, pace, distance and have a real feedback on their physical activities. Also, using technology has made it much safer, fairer, and more attractive to practice sport. The technological improvements will continuously have a big impact on sports.

TI Sport Nationalism in South Korea: An Ethnographic Study
SO SAGE OPEN
AB This article examines the history and characteristics of sport nationalism in South Korea as a step toward a comparative study in East Asia, with special emphasis on media, postcolonial history of the policies, and the ritual dimension of sport. The Korean government has sought triumphalism embodied by a focused strategy of close collaboration at the state and local levels, elitist training method, special rewards for athletes' distinguished results, and so on. Nationwide enthusiasm promoted by media creates nationalistic solidarity. In postcolonial South Korea, sport has been used as a special tool to achieve focused political aims, such as prevailing against the anti-communist and anti-Japanese competitions. But recently, as the Korean society becomes more affluent and matured, people begin to enjoy the appeal of sport per se. The mega sport events, including public viewing, present a typical scene of Korean nationalistic enthusiasm, but it is also a good example of ritual consumption and the development of sport as art. To understand the vitality of sport in East Asia, it is important to notice the coexistence of the non-utilitarian aspect of sports with their political and ritual use.

TI Redefining Sports: Esports, Environments, Signals and Functions
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ELECTRONICS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS
AB sports landscape is constantly changing due to innovation and entrepreneurship. The availability of technology led to the emergence of esports and augmented sports. Biofeed-back and sensing technologies can be used for athlete monitoring and training purposes. Research on motor control deals with planning and execution of bodily movements and provides some insights towards formal presentation of sports. Previous research provided many sports categorization models. On many occasions, published articles did not distinguish com-petitive gameplay activities (gaming) from athletic performance (esports). Our goal was to define esports by extending existing universal sport definitions and propose a novel modular compu-tational framework for categorizing sports through environments and signals. We have fulfilled our goals by illustrating how signals flow within competitive (sports) environments. Our esports definition introduces esports as a group of sports similar to motorsports. Moreover, we have defined mathematical foundations for signal processing by various actors (athletes, referees, environments, intermediate processing steps). We have demonstrated that rep-resenting sports as a multidimensional signal can lead to the categorization of sports through computation. We claim that our approach could be applied to transfer training methods from similar sports, analysis of the training process, and referee error measurement. Our study was not without limitations. Further research is required to validate our theoretical model by embedding available variables in latent space to calculate similarity measures between sports.

TI Application of wearable technologies for player motion analysis in
   racket sports: A systematic review
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPORTS SCIENCE & COACHING
AB The use of wearable devices for player motion analysis is becoming a popular method to measure kinematic parameters associated with player techniques in racket sports. This systematic review focused on identifying the current applications of wearable technology for player motion analysis in racket sports (tennis, table tennis, badminton and squash) through two research questions: (1) What are the existing applications of wearable technology for player motion analysis in racket sports? (2) What data analysis methods are used to quantify and evaluate player motion? A comprehensive search of MEDLINE, EMBASE, SPORTDiscus, Scopus, Web of Science, and IEEE databases was undertaken following PRISMA reporting guidelines. Included studies must have only used external wearable technology mounted to either the player or the racket for the potential application of player motion analysis in a racket sport, tested the wearable technology under normal playing conditions and not only focused on detecting/classifying the player's stroke or activity movement. Of the 6616 articles found, a total of 15 studies met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Tennis and table tennis were the most popular sports researched and inertial measurement units and electromyography sensors were the most common types of sensors used. This review found that wearable devices were mainly used to analyze (1) movement similarities and differences of players at different playing levels, (2) variability in racket, upper limb and joint movement patterns and (3) movement differences associated with different ball spin levels. These technologies can create a new level of accessible personalized training in these sports.

This paper draws a conclusion that our modern sports industry activities are concentrated in a few large coastal cuties, so their developments are uneven between regions and they are on the small scale. With the increasing market demand caused by the widespread of the modern sports items, the sale and manufacturing of sports goods in modern China develops slowly on the basis of the consignment of foreign products and through the continuous study, the improvement of production technology, the patriotic passion and the restoring of national economic rights. In the case of the backward production technology of sports goods, it is not easy for China to create its own brands and sell its products far to the south-eastern Asian countries. The sports goods (sports clothes and sports shoes) production of modern China developed from non-standardization to standardization and from handiwork to massive production, with the development of the industrial production of modern China in all fields, especially in the field of the rubber industry.

TI Keeping it free: Sport television and public policy in Australia
SO JOURNAL OF DIGITAL MEDIA & POLICY
AB This article addresses issues surrounding changes in television in the digital age, focusing specifically on questions of cultural citizenship as they relate to sport on television. It considers the curious neglect of sport in the Australian Government's 2020 'Media Reform Green Paper: Modernising television regulation in Australia', especially given its focus on the current problems of free-to-air (FTA) television and the importance of sport to it. In Australia, as in many other countries, there is some legislative protection to enable sport 'events of national importance and cultural significance' to be broadcast without charge to whole national communities, thereby preventing their 'siphoning' by subscription television providers. These regulatory arrangements have come under increasing pressure, including from screen-based content providers offering over-the-top (OTT) internet-enabled, on-demand streaming services. The article considers the public policy and social equity ramifications of regulating screen-based sport in this dynamic media environment. It is argued that there is a strong case for an anti siphoning list covering selected live sport events to be maintained, revised as necessary and protected from circumvention in an era where FTA television remains a popular, reliable and widely accessible media technology that has minimal barriers to viewing citizens. We conclude that television regulation in Australia cannot be 'modernised' by allowing the anti-siphoning regime to wither on the vine in gesturing to technological innovation, market de-regulation and unequal choice. Such interventions in national media and sport markets can, it is proposed, enable the necessary innovation to enhance rather than erode cultural citizenship rights for the benefit of large segments of society.

AB Recently, sport climbing has become popular throughout the world. Sport climbing is an extreme sport where people climb an artificial wall with various artificial holds using their hands and feet. Technique training related to using hands and feet is necessary for novice climbers, hence we need effective training contents. The purpose of this research is to analyze postures and movements in sport climbing using Microsoft Kinect for realistic 3D climbing animations. A professional male climber participated in this research in order to obtain good movements for the animations. We divided a climbing cycle into four phase and analyzed each phase. The posture and movement data in sport climbing which are analyzed through this research will be used to make realistic 3D character animation. (C) 2015 The Authors. Published by Elsevier Ltd.
