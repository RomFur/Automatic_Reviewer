AB In order to build a software architecture suitable to robotic soccer, it is necessary to model the base concepts of human soccer. In human soccer, the coach plays an important role in planning the moves, tactics and strategies to prepare its team to a match, while in robotic soccer the coach usually does not exist. The architecture must be concerned by concepts like coach, player, player's role, play/move, formation, tactic and strategy, in order to plan and play "correctly" a match. Although there exists other works using these terms, their definitions are not standardized, leading to confusion because they use the same term for different concepts. We propose a definition closer to human soccer facilitating the description of particular instances of players, tactics and strategies. In this way, a human soccer coach can express his ideas and apply them to a robotic soccer match. This paper presents these definitions, their relationships and their application helping the coach to describe his team, his strategies and to deal with the match dynamics. Software process will be used to build architecture and to implement the system. This system will be tested in the simulation category of RoboCup.

TI Performing more than 20 purposeful gameplay headers in a soccer season
   may alter autonomic function in female youth soccer players
SO RESEARCH IN SPORTS MEDICINE
AB This study evaluated the effects of cumulative purposeful soccer heading on autonomic nervous system function in 22 female youth soccer players (13.3 +/- 0.9 years). A 10 minute electrocardiogram recording was collected at baseline and following the 20 game season (post-season) to calculate measures of heart rate variability (HRV), including standard deviation of the normal-normal intervals, total power, high frequency (HF), low frequency (LF), LF:HF, normalized HF and normalized LF. Participants were categorized into low- (<20 headers per season; n = 13) and high- (>20 headers per season; n = 9) exposure groups. Mann-Whitney U tests demonstrated no significant differences between groups for any HRV metric. However, the increased normalized LF power (low exposure 8.67 and high exposure -31.17, respectively; r = 0.35) and LF:HF power (-6.39 and 15.80, respectively; r = 0.35), between groups had moderate practical significance. Therefore, female youth players who perform more than 20 purposeful headers during a soccer season may exhibit altered autonomic function.

TI Perceived Soccer Literacy: A Construct Linking Soccer Video Games Play
   to Soccer Engagement
SO SPORT MARKETING QUARTERLY
AB This study investigates soccer video games as a platform to promote soccer engagement (i.e., involvement, behavioral intentions) among those who do not physically play soccer regularly. Perceived soccer literacy is proposed as a construct explaining the promotional effect, consisting of the four sub -themes of affective attitude, perceived functional knowledge, perceived critical knowledge, and perceived competence. A study was conducted based on an online survey and with US and Canadian adults who do not physically play soccer on a regular basis. With structural equation modeling, (1) the association between soccer video game use and perceived soccer literacy was examined (via mean comparison) and (2) perceived soccer literacy's link to soccer involvement and behavioral intentions was tested (via latent variable path analysis). Positive links were reported from soccer video games usage to all four sub -themes. Perceived soccer literacy imposed significant influences on soccer involvement/intentions, where perceived critical knowledge was the most influential.

TI Direct player observation is needed to accurately quantify heading
   frequency in youth soccer
SO RESEARCH IN SPORTS MEDICINE
AB In soccer, heading may be related to subsequent neurological impairment. Accurate measures of heading exposure are therefore important. This study evaluated whether 12 female youth players accurately recalled their average number of headers over an entire soccer season (20 games total). Their self-reported average number of headers per game was multiplied by the number of games that they participated in, and were compared to actual number of headers extracted from game video. All players overestimated the number of headers compared to game video. Linear regression analysis indicated that self-reported headers overestimated the number of headers by 51%. While self-reports are a convenient way to estimate heading behaviour, they do not accurately represent the number of headers that players perform. Self-reports of heading exposure should be interpreted with caution.
