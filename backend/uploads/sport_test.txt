AB In order to build a software architecture suitable to robotic soccer, it is necessary to model the base concepts of human soccer. In human soccer, the coach plays an important role in planning the moves, tactics and strategies to prepare its team to a match, while in robotic soccer the coach usually does not exist. The architecture must be concerned by concepts like coach, player, player's role, play/move, formation, tactic and strategy, in order to plan and play "correctly" a match. Although there exists other works using these terms, their definitions are not standardized, leading to confusion because they use the same term for different concepts. We propose a definition closer to human soccer facilitating the description of particular instances of players, tactics and strategies. In this way, a human soccer coach can express his ideas and apply them to a robotic soccer match. This paper presents these definitions, their relationships and their application helping the coach to describe his team, his strategies and to deal with the match dynamics. Software process will be used to build architecture and to implement the system. This system will be tested in the simulation category of RoboCup.

TI Performing more than 20 purposeful gameplay headers in a soccer season
   may alter autonomic function in female youth soccer players
SO RESEARCH IN SPORTS MEDICINE
AB This study evaluated the effects of cumulative purposeful soccer heading on autonomic nervous system function in 22 female youth soccer players (13.3 +/- 0.9 years). A 10 minute electrocardiogram recording was collected at baseline and following the 20 game season (post-season) to calculate measures of heart rate variability (HRV), including standard deviation of the normal-normal intervals, total power, high frequency (HF), low frequency (LF), LF:HF, normalized HF and normalized LF. Participants were categorized into low- (<20 headers per season; n = 13) and high- (>20 headers per season; n = 9) exposure groups. Mann-Whitney U tests demonstrated no significant differences between groups for any HRV metric. However, the increased normalized LF power (low exposure 8.67 and high exposure -31.17, respectively; r = 0.35) and LF:HF power (-6.39 and 15.80, respectively; r = 0.35), between groups had moderate practical significance. Therefore, female youth players who perform more than 20 purposeful headers during a soccer season may exhibit altered autonomic function.
