AB In order to build a software architecture suitable to robotic soccer, it is necessary to model the base concepts of human soccer. In human soccer, the coach plays an important role in planning the moves, tactics and strategies to prepare its team to a match, while in robotic soccer the coach usually does not exist. The architecture must be concerned by concepts like coach, player, player's role, play/move, formation, tactic and strategy, in order to plan and play "correctly" a match. Although there exists other works using these terms, their definitions are not standardized, leading to confusion because they use the same term for different concepts. We propose a definition closer to human soccer facilitating the description of particular instances of players, tactics and strategies. In this way, a human soccer coach can express his ideas and apply them to a robotic soccer match. This paper presents these definitions, their relationships and their application helping the coach to describe his team, his strategies and to deal with the match dynamics. Software process will be used to build architecture and to implement the system. This system will be tested in the simulation category of RoboCup.

TI Performing more than 20 purposeful gameplay headers in a soccer season
   may alter autonomic function in female youth soccer players
SO RESEARCH IN SPORTS MEDICINE
AB This study evaluated the effects of cumulative purposeful soccer heading on autonomic nervous system function in 22 female youth soccer players (13.3 +/- 0.9 years). A 10 minute electrocardiogram recording was collected at baseline and following the 20 game season (post-season) to calculate measures of heart rate variability (HRV), including standard deviation of the normal-normal intervals, total power, high frequency (HF), low frequency (LF), LF:HF, normalized HF and normalized LF. Participants were categorized into low- (<20 headers per season; n = 13) and high- (>20 headers per season; n = 9) exposure groups. Mann-Whitney U tests demonstrated no significant differences between groups for any HRV metric. However, the increased normalized LF power (low exposure 8.67 and high exposure -31.17, respectively; r = 0.35) and LF:HF power (-6.39 and 15.80, respectively; r = 0.35), between groups had moderate practical significance. Therefore, female youth players who perform more than 20 purposeful headers during a soccer season may exhibit altered autonomic function.

TI Perceived Soccer Literacy: A Construct Linking Soccer Video Games Play
   to Soccer Engagement
SO SPORT MARKETING QUARTERLY
AB This study investigates soccer video games as a platform to promote soccer engagement (i.e., involvement, behavioral intentions) among those who do not physically play soccer regularly. Perceived soccer literacy is proposed as a construct explaining the promotional effect, consisting of the four sub -themes of affective attitude, perceived functional knowledge, perceived critical knowledge, and perceived competence. A study was conducted based on an online survey and with US and Canadian adults who do not physically play soccer on a regular basis. With structural equation modeling, (1) the association between soccer video game use and perceived soccer literacy was examined (via mean comparison) and (2) perceived soccer literacy's link to soccer involvement and behavioral intentions was tested (via latent variable path analysis). Positive links were reported from soccer video games usage to all four sub -themes. Perceived soccer literacy imposed significant influences on soccer involvement/intentions, where perceived critical knowledge was the most influential.

TI Direct player observation is needed to accurately quantify heading
   frequency in youth soccer
SO RESEARCH IN SPORTS MEDICINE
AB In soccer, heading may be related to subsequent neurological impairment. Accurate measures of heading exposure are therefore important. This study evaluated whether 12 female youth players accurately recalled their average number of headers over an entire soccer season (20 games total). Their self-reported average number of headers per game was multiplied by the number of games that they participated in, and were compared to actual number of headers extracted from game video. All players overestimated the number of headers compared to game video. Linear regression analysis indicated that self-reported headers overestimated the number of headers by 51%. While self-reports are a convenient way to estimate heading behaviour, they do not accurately represent the number of headers that players perform. Self-reports of heading exposure should be interpreted with caution.

TI Soccer-Specific Endurance and Running Economy in Soccer Players With
   Cerebral Palsy
SO ADAPTED PHYSICAL ACTIVITY QUARTERLY
AB The purpose of this study was to describe running economy, soccer specific endurance, and selected kinematic running criteria in soccer players with cerebral palsy (SPCP) and to compare them with values of position-matched players without CP. Fourteen international, male soccer players with cerebral palsy completed the "Yo-Yo" intermittent recovery run level 1 (IRL-1) test to assess soccer-specific endurance and a submaximal running test on a treadmill to determine running economy. The mean IRL-1 distance covered by the SPCP of the Irish CP team was found to be 43-50% below the mean distance attained by position-matched soccer players without disability, while running economy was found to be within the range of that reported for able-bodied athletes. No relationship could be found between the level of CP-ISRA classification and soccer-specific endurance or running economy in this group of elite level SPCP. Though small in number, these data support a further examination of the relationship between CP classification and sport-specific performance.

TI Soccer, images and professionalization: soccer plays with every teenage
   dream
SO MOVIMENTO
AB The study aims to analyze the social elements in the construction of attitudes that lead teenagers who practice soccer to go for professionalization in such sport. It uses open interviews, collecting testimonies from nine adolescents aged 13 to 16 years old in two soccer teams in the cities of Vitoria and Cariacica. The reductions of the interviews were based on the discursive analysis of Maingueneau (1998) and the theoretical discussion examined the categories dream and images in Marc Auge (1994). It concludes that the family, the television media and the soccer anonymous are the motivators for continuing the dream of teenagers to become professional soccer players.

SO JOURNAL OF HUMAN KINETICS
AB The purpose of this study was to analyze the leadership power perceptions of soccer coaches and soccer players according to their educational levels. Data were collected from 165 male soccer coaches and 870 male soccer players. Adapted versions of the "Power in Soccer Questionnaire-Other", the "Power in Soccer Questionnaire-Self" and an "information form" were used for data collection, and collected data were analyzed by the Kruskal-Wallis and the Mann-Whitney Tests. Analysis of the Power in Soccer Questionnaire-Other revealed significant differences between soccer players' level of education and their perception of Coercive Power (p<.003), and no significant differences related to Referent Power, Legitimate Power and Expert Power. Analysis of the Power in Soccer Questionnaire-Self also revealed the only significant difference between coaches' level of education and their perception of Legitimate Power (p<.001), and no significant differences with regard to others. Different perception of leadership powers between coaches and players might create communication and performance problems in soccer.

TI The biomechanics of soccer: A review
SO JOURNAL OF SPORTS SCIENCES
AB This review considers the biomechanical factors that are relevant to success in the game of soccer. Three broad areas are covered: (1) the technical performance of soccer skills; (2) the equipment used in playing the game; and (3) the causative mechanisms of specific soccer injuries.
   Kicking is the most widely studied soccer skill. Although there are many types of kick, the variant most widely reported in the literature is the maximum velocity instep kick of a stationary ball. In contrast, several other skills, such as throwing-in and goalkeeping, have received little attention; some, for example passing and trapping the ball, tackling, falling behaviour, jumping, running, sprinting, starting, stopping and changing direction, have not been the subject of any detailed biomechanical investigation.
   The items of equipment reviewed are boots, the ball, artificial and natural turf surfaces and shin guards. Little of the research conducted by equipment manufacturers is in the public domain; this part of the review therefore concentrates on the mechanical responses of equipment, player-equipment interaction, and the effects of equipment on player performance and protection. Although the equipment has mechanical characteristics that can be reasonably well quantified, the player-equipment interaction is more difficult to establish; this makes its efficacy for performance or protection difficult to predict.
   Some soccer injuries may be attributable to the equipment used. The soccer boot has a poor protective capability, but careful design can have a minor influence on reducing the severity of ankle inversion injuries. Performance requirements limit the scope for reducing these injuries; alternative methods for providing ankle stability are necessary. Artificial surfaces result in injury profiles different from those on natural turf pitches. There is a tendency for fewer serious injuries, but more minor injuries, on artificial turf than on natural turf pitches. Players adapt to surface types over a period of several games. Therefore, changing from one surface to another is a major aetiological factor in surface-related injuries. Heading the ball could lead to long-term brain damage. Simulation studies suggest the importance of ball mass, ball speed and player mass in affecting the severity of impact. Careful instruction and skill development, together with the correct equipment, is necessary for young players.
   Most applications of biomechanical techniques to soccer have been descriptive experimental studies. Biomechanical modelling techniques have helped in the understanding of the underlying mechanisms of performance, although their use has been limited. It is concluded that there are still many features of the game of soccer that are amenable to biomechanical treatment, and many opportunities for biomechanists to make a contribution to the science of soccer.

TI Assessing visual attention using soccer game videos in elite female
   soccer player
SO INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF SPORT PSYCHOLOGY
AB Background: Visual attention is critical in team sports, and multiple object tracking (MOT) task is a well-established experimental method for assessing it. This study aims to use a visual tracking task based on a soccer game video to compare the impact of different numbers of targets on the visual tracking performance of soccer players and that of non-soccer players. Methods: 14 Chinese female soccer players (average age: 20.2 +/- 1.6 years) and 20 Chinese female non-soccer players (average age: 20.3 +/- 1.4 years) were selected to participate in the video-based MOT task with varying attentional load (four, six, or eight targets). This study examined the difference of dynamic visual attention features between female soccer players and non-players by changing the number of targets. Results: A significant main effect of target number on tracking accuracy was identified, with accuracy decreasing as the number of targets increased (p < 0.001). Additionally, group differences were significant (p < 0.001), with female soccer players demonstrating superior accuracy compared to non-players. Furthermore, there was a significant interaction effect between group and target number (p < 0.05), indicating that female soccer players showed better tracking performance compared to non-players across various target quantities (i.e., 4, 6, and 8 targets). Specifically, within the group of female soccer players, tracking accuracy for 4 targets was significantly higher than for 6 and 8 targets (p < 0.05), yet no significant difference was observed between the tracking accuracies for 6 and 8 targets (p > 0.05). Discussion: This study examined MOT for the first time using a video-based assessment method. Overall, the results suggest that video-based MOT is a sensitive measure to assess the visual tracking ability of female soccer players. In addition, the effect of expertise in female soccer games was found transferable to attention tasks related to other types of sports games. In order to provide better suggestions on performance in sports games, future research can adopt a more realistic game environment and incorporate motor-cognitive tasks.

   athletes
SO AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE
AB Background: Gender-based differences in injury rates have been reported in scholastic and collegiate basketball. The purpose of this study was to retrospectively compare injury rates in women's and men's professional basketball.
   Hypothesis: Female professional basketball players are injured at a higher rate than are men.
   Study Design: Cohort study (prevalence); Level of evidence, 2.
   Methods: Women's National Basketball Association and National Basketball Association injury data were retrospectively reviewed for 6 full seasons. The frequency of all injuries and the rate of game-related injuries were calculated.
   Results: Complete player profiles were obtained on 702 National Basketball Association athletes and 443 Women's National Basketball Association athletes who competed in their respective leagues during the data collection period. Total game exposures totaled 70 420 (National Basketball Association) and 22 980 (Women's National Basketball Association). Women's National Basketball Association athletes had a higher overall game-related injury rate (24.9 per 1000 athlete exposures; 95% confidence interval, 22.9-26.9; P < .05) when compared with National Basketball Association athletes (19.3 per 1000 athlete exposures; 95% confidence interval, 18.3-20.4) and sustained a higher rate of lower extremity injuries (14.6 per 1000 athlete exposures; 95% confidence interval, 13.1-16.2; P < .05) than seen in the National Basketball Association (11.6 per 1000 athlete exposures; 95% confidence interval, 10.8-12.4). The lower extremity was the most commonly injured body area (65%), and lateral ankle sprain (13.7%) was the most common diagnosis in both leagues. The incidence of game-related knee injury was higher in Women's National Basketball Association players. The incidence of anterior cruciate ligament injury in the National Basketball Association (n = 22, 0.8%) and Women's National Basketball Association (n = 14, 0.9%) accounted for 0.8% of the 4446 injuries reported.
   Conclusion: The lower extremity is the most frequently injured body area in both leagues, and Women's National Basketball Association athletes are more susceptible than are National Basketball Association athletes. There were, however, few statistical differences in the actual injuries occurring between the 2 leagues.

TI Physiological Responses and Technical-Tactical Performance of Youth
   Basketball Players: A Brief Comparison between 3x3 and 5x5 Basketball
SO JOURNAL OF SPORTS SCIENCE AND MEDICINE
AB This study aims to examine youth players??? physiological responses and technical-tactical performance when playing simulated 3x3 and 5x5 basketball games. Fifteen well-trained male basketball players (16.6 ?? 0.2 years old) participated in scrimmage basketball games under two different conditions: 3x3 (half-court) and 5x5 (full-court). The players??? heart rate, muscle oxygen saturation and total hemoglobin data were collected and computed to describe physiological responses, while video analysis was used to characterize their technical-tactical performance. A Bayesian one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to quantify the predictive influence of both game conditions on the physiological and the technical-tactical variables. The results indicated that different game conditions influenced the players??? physiological responses slightly, as only hemoglobin sample entropy increased between the 3x3 and 5x5 game scenarios. Conversely, statistical differences in most of the technical-tactical variables were moderate and decisive in favour of the game condition model. Overall, this study emphasizes that playing 3x3 and 5x5 basketball games lead to relatively negligible differences in the players??? physiological response but pronounced variations in their technical-tactical performance. Therefore, important implications may be drawn to the applied field as the specificity of technical-tactical adaptations when playing 3x3 or 5x5 formats should be considered by basketball coaches to better design the training sessions for players that fall within our sample age category.

TI Basketball Action Data Processing Method Based on Mode Symmetric
   Algorithm
SO SYMMETRY-BASEL
AB In the course of basketball training, a large number of basketball action data are generated according to the athletes' body movements. Due to the low precision of the basketball action data processed by the traditional method in basketball technical training, basketball action processing is not in place. The basketball motion data processing method, based on the mode symmetric algorithm was studied. The basketball motion detection algorithm based on symmetric difference and background reduction was used to remove the background influence of basketball movement and obtain the binary basketball action target image containing the data. On this basis, the pole symmetric mode decomposition (ESMD) method was used to modally decompose the binary basketball action target image containing the data, and the least squares method was used to optimize the elliptic (AGM) curve to realize the screening of basketball action modal data. Through the cleaning and integration of basketball action modal data, integration and data reduction basketball action modal data, the data was processed efficiently. The experimental results showed that the proposed method was a high precision and high efficiency basketball action data processing method.

AB With the continuous progress of society and the development of globalization, the life of our people has also changed a lot. Of course, these changes are reflected in the cost of eating and learning and learning, many aspects of our daily lives have been affected. Which is also a way to exercise, there are many young people are very concerned about the NBA or CBA, for basketball is very love. Basketball is not our local movement in China, but from abroad to introduce a movement. And this kind of sport is now very popular in all kinds of high efficiency. And often organize some league or friendly to develop the sport in the efficient popularity. But the basketball game winning and losing and the overall quality of basketball players are very close relationship. Colleges and universities often have a dedicated basketball coach to train basketball players, but the overall quality of basketball players is multifaceted, although the instructor's guidance is very important, but the basketball player's own factors can not be ignored. Which is relatively large impact on the overall quality of basketball players basketball technology, of course, far from mobilization of their own physical fitness, mental health and teamwork for the overall quality of basketball players is also a great impact. Only a basketball player to achieve a certain level of overall quality, he can play in the basketball game even better. In order to speed up the development of basketball players, people have made in-depth research on the basketball technology of athletes, and the establishment of a basketball technology model to help them improve their basketball technology, and thus improve their overall quality, then we will specifically explore the analysis of this The rationality of the practice, that is, the basketball technology model for the overall quality of basketball players.

TI Scheduling the Italian National Volleyball Tournament
SO INTERFACES
AB In this paper, we present our approach to sports scheduling, a process that led the Italian Volleyball League to adopt our calendar for the 2016-2017 and subsequent seasons. Sports scheduling is a hard combinatorial optimization problem whose solution requires modeling many different aspects of sports, some of which are unique to each sport or nation. The capability of producing a high-quality schedule is important for both balancing undesirable matches among teams and ensuring adequate coverage by television and other media. Through strong interaction with the Italian Volleyball League, we modeled and solved the problem to optimality using standard mathematical programming solvers. We also tested our solution using previous seasons' tournaments to prove the capability of our model.

TI Injuries in Youth Volleyball Players at a National Championship:
   Incidence, Risk Factors, and Mechanisms of Injury
SO CLINICAL JOURNAL OF SPORT MEDICINE
AB Objective:To evaluate injury incidence rates, types, mechanisms, and potential risk factors in youth volleyball.Design:Prospective cohort.Setting:2018 Canadian Youth National Volleyball Tournament.Participants:Thousand eight hundred seventy-six players [466 males, 1391 females, mean age 16.2 years (& PLUSMN;1.26)] consented to participate (19.5%).Assessment of Risk Factors:Sex (male/female), age group, position, and underage players.Main Outcome Measures:Players completed a questionnaire (demographic information, injury, and concussion history). Medical attention injuries were recorded by tournament medical personnel through an injury report form (eg, mechanism and type). Injury was defined as any physical complaint seeking onsite medical attention. Concussion was defined using the fifth International Consensus. Injury rates adjusted for cluster by team were calculated by sex. Exploratory multivariable Poisson regression was used to analyze potential risk factors (eg, sex, age group, position, and underage players) for injury, adjusted for cluster by team and offset by athlete exposures (AEs).Results:There were 101 injuries in the 7-day tournament {IRFemale = 6.78 injuries/1000 AEs [95% confidence interval (CI), 5.27-8.72]; IRMale = 4.30 injuries/1000 AEs (95% CI, 2.55-7.24)}. Joint sprain (n = 29, 28.71%) and concussion (n = 26, 25.74%) were the most common. Most concussions were associated with ball-to-head contact (61.5%). There was no statistically significant difference in injury rate by sex (IRRF/M: 1.47; 95% CI, 0.80-2.69). The rates of injury in U14 were higher than U18 (IRRU14: 2.57; 95% CI, 1.11-5.98).Conclusions:Injury rates are high in youth volleyball tournament play, with the highest rates in U14. More research is needed to inform the development of volleyball-specific injury prevention strategies.

TI Recovery in volleyball
SO JOURNAL OF SPORTS MEDICINE AND PHYSICAL FITNESS
AB INTRODUCTION: In current team sports (including volleyball), the players have to play numerous competitive matches without time to recover. Volleyball can be defined as a moderate duration exercise including repeated bouts of high-intensity activity interspersed with brief periods of low to moderate active recovery or passive rest. A match is characterized by repeated explosive activities, such as: jumps, shuffles and rapid changes in direction.
   EVIDENCE ACQUISITION: To guarantee adequate recovery after matches, it is necessary to know the type of fatigue induced and if possible its underlying mechanisms. Recovery strategies are commonly utilized in volleyball despite limited scientific confirmation to support their effectiveness to facilitating optimal recovery.
   EVIDENCE SYNTHESIS: It is particularly important to optimize recovery because players spend a much greater proportion of their time recovering than they do in training.
   CONCLUSIONS: Therefore, the main aim of this brief review is to facilitate useful information for practical application, based on the scientific evidence and applied knowledge specifically in volleyball.

TI EFFECTS OF WHOLE BODY VIBRATION ON STRENGTH AND JUMPING PERFORMANCE IN
   VOLLEYBALL AND BEACH VOLLEYBALL PLAYERS
SO BIOLOGY OF SPORT
AB The primary aim of this study was to examine the effects of 6-week strength training with whole body vibration (WBV) on leg strength and jumping performance in volleyball and beach volleyball players. Twenty-three sub-elite male volleyball (VB; n=12) and beach volleyball players (BVB; n=11) aged 21.2 +/- 3.0 years were divided into two groups and subjected to 6 weeks of strength training (three one-hour sessions per week): (I) 12 players (6 VB and 6 BVB players) underwent training with WBV (30-40 Hz, 1.7-2.5 mm, 3.0-5.7 g), and (II) 11 players (6 VB and 5 BVB players) underwent traditional strength training. Squat jump (Si) and countermovement squat jump (CMJ) measurements by the Ergo Tester contact platform and maximum leg press test (1RM) were conducted. Three-factor (2 time x 2 WBV use x 2 discipline) analysis of variance for Si, CMJ and 1RM revealed a significanttime main effect (p<0.001), a WBV use effect (p<0.001) and a discipline effect (p<0.001). Significantly greater improvements in the Si (p<0.001) and CMJ (p<0.001) and in 1RM (p<0.001) were found in the WBV training groups than in traditional training groups. Significant 3-way interaction effects (training, WBV use, discipline kind) were also found for Si, CMJ and 1RM (p=0.001, p<0.001, p=0.001, respectively). It can be concluded that implementation of 6-week WBV training in routine practice in volleyball and beach volleyball players increases leg strength more and leads to greater improvement in jump performance than traditional strength training, but greater improvements can be expected in beach volleyball players than in volleyball players.

TI Landing Techniques in Beach Volleyball
SO JOURNAL OF SPORTS SCIENCE AND MEDICINE
AB The aims of the present study were to establish a detailed and representative record of landing techniques (two-, left-, and right-footed landings) in professional beach volleyball and compare the data with those of indoor volleyball. Beach volleyball data was retrieved from videos taken at FIVB World Tour tournaments. Landing techniques were compared in the different beach and indoor volleyball skills serve, set, attack, and block with regard to sex, playing technique, and court position. Significant differences were observed between men and women in landings following block actions (chi(2)(2) = 18.19, p < 0.01) but not following serve, set, and attack actions. Following blocking, men landed more often on one foot than women. Further differences in landings following serve and attack with regard to playing technique and position were mainly observed in men. The comparison with landing techniques in indoor volleyball revealed overall differences both in men (chi(2)(2) = 161.4, p < 0.01) and women (chi(2)(2) = 84.91, p < 0.01). Beach volleyball players land more often on both feet than indoor volleyball players. Besides the softer surface in beach volleyball, and therefore resulting lower loads, these results might be another reason for fewer injuries and overuse conditions compared to indoor volleyball.

TI Self-reported symptoms and risk factors for digital ischaemia among
   international world-class beach volleyball players
SO JOURNAL OF SPORTS SCIENCES
AB The prevalence of ischaemia-related symptoms is remarkably high among elite indoor volleyball players. Since the exposure to sport-specific demands may be higher in beach volleyball compared to indoor volleyball, the aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of ischaemia-related symptoms and associated risk factors among world-class beach volleyball players. Therefore, a questionnaire survey was performed among beach volleyball players active during the 2013 Grand Slam Beach Volleyball in the Netherlands. In total, 60 of the 128 beach volleyball players (47%) participated: 26 males and 34 females from 17 countries. The self-reported prevalence of cold or blue or pale digits in the dominant hand during or immediately after practice or competition was 38% (n=23). Two risk factors were independently associated with symptoms of blue or pale digits: more than 14years playing volleyball (odds ratio (OR) 4.42, 90% confidence interval (90% CI) 1.30-15.07) and sex (female) (OR 4.62, 90% CI 1.15-18.57). In conclusion, the prevalence of symptoms associated with digital ischaemia is high among international world-class beach volleyball players. Female sex and the length of the volleyball career were independently associated with an increased risk of ischaemia-related symptoms. The high prevalence of these seemingly innocuous symptoms and possible associated risk factors warrant regular monitoring since early detection can potentially prevent thromboembolic complications and irreversible tissue damage.

   RESPONSES TO CARDIO TENNIS
SO JOURNAL OF STRENGTH AND CONDITIONING RESEARCH
AB Murphy, AP, Duffield, R, and Reid, M. Tennis for physical health: Acute age- and gender-based physiological responses to Cardio tennis. J Strength Cond Res 28(11): 3177-3183, 2014This study described physiological and perceptual responses to Cardio tennis for younger and older adult populations of both sexes for health-related outcomes. Thirty-one active participants, each with prior recreational tennis experience (approximate to 2 years) (8 younger and 8 older males, and 7 younger and 8 older females) performed preliminary testing and a 50-minute instructor-led Cardio tennis session. Cardio tennis is a conditioning-based tennis program comprised of warm-up movements, drill-based exercises (set movement and hitting games), and competitive play scenarios. Participants performed the 20-m shuttle run test to determine maximal heart rate (HR) during preliminary testing. Before, after, and 30-minute post Cardio tennis session, HR, blood pressure (BP), rate pressure product (RPP), and capillary blood lactate and glucose were determined. Furthermore, HR and pedometer-derived step counts were measured throughout, while the session was filmed and coded for technical skill. After the session, ratings of perceived exertion, enjoyment, and challenge were obtained. Heart rate, systolic BP, and RPP were significantly increased by Cardio tennis (p 0.05), though returned to pre-exercise levels after 30 minutes (p > 0.05). Heart rate and BP did not differ between groups pre- or 30-minute postexercise (p > 0.05); however, these were lower in younger males during and higher in younger females postsession (p 0.05). Lactate and glucose concentrations were increased in all groups (p 0.05), with lactate being highest in male groups (p 0.05), without differences in glucose between groups (p > 0.05). Stroke and step counts were not different between groups (p > 0.05). Ratings of perceived exertion and perceived challenge were lowest in the younger male group compared with all other groups (p 0.05). Cardio tennis presents as an effective stimulus to invoke sufficient cardiovascular and metabolic load to benefit health and fitness, though age- and sex-based responses should be considered in prescription.

TI The Hit Turn Tennis Test: An acoustically controlled endurance test for
   tennis players
SO JOURNAL OF SPORTS SCIENCES
AB This study was conducted to validate and evaluate the oHit Turn Tennis Testo, an acoustically progressive on-court endurance test for tennis players. Ninety-eight competitive tennis players (53 males, 45 females) of different age groups participated in the study. For validation, the adult male players completed three Hit Turn tests, one on a clay court and two on a carpet surface, a tennis-specific ball machine test and an incremental treadmill run in a randomized order. A stronger correlation between maximal performance (r=0.81, P0.01) and maximal oxygen uptake (r=0.96, P0.01) was observed between the Hit Turn test and the ball machine test, than between the Hit Turn test and the treadmill test. For test-retest, we found a significant correlation between maximal performance on the same (r=0.83, P0.01) and on different surfaces (r=0.74, P0.01). During test evaluation, maximal performance was higher in males than in females (P0.01) and increased by consecutive age group in boys (P0.01) but not in girls (P=0.97). In conclusion, Hit Turn maximum test performance can be recommended as a valid and reliable indicator for tennis-specific endurance.

TI Tennis Patterns Recognition Based on a Novel Tennis Dataset - 3DTennisDS
SO ADVANCES IN SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY-RESEARCH JOURNAL
AB Many scientific studies on tennis stroke recognition are based on datasets, that have been developed for particular studies, using video or motion capture techniques. The importance of such datasets has been increasing due to the athlete performance evaluation needs. The primary contribution of this study is to present a state-of-the-art 3DTennisDS storing four tennis moves: backhand, forehand, volley backhand as well as volley forehand. The strokes were registered using the Vicon optical motion capture and contain a 39 - marker player and a 7 - marker tennis racket models. The potential and quality of this unique dataset has been verified using spatial-temporal graph neural networks, because this type of network topology matches to the human body structure. The presented 3DTennisDS has been compared with two well-known datasets: the THETIS and the Tennis-Mocap. They contain tennis movements in a form of motion capture data, registered using markerless and marker-based systems. The classification of tennis movements has been performed to verify how different types of data acquisition (marker-based and marker-less ones) as well as the structure of the data affect the accuracy of human action recognition. In this study ONI files from THETIS, bvh from Tennis-Mocap and c3d data from 3DTennisDS were considered. Moreover, the impact of input data fuzzification was examined. The obtained results showed that the classification using 3DTennisDS achieved the best results, both for fuzzy and non-fuzzy inputs. These outcomes indicate that the way of capturing data, its preparation and structure have great influence on classification accuracy. The developed 3DTennisDS has a great potential in further motion capture analysis.

TI Understanding parental stressors: An investigation of British
   tennis-parents
SO JOURNAL OF SPORTS SCIENCES
AB In this study, we examined the stressors experienced by British tennis-parents. The parents (n=123) completed an extensive survey focused on the internal and external demands that they had encountered through having a child compete in the sport. The survey consisted of open-ended questions related to competition, coaching, organizational, personal, and developmental issues. Inductive and deductive content analysis resulted in the development of seven core themes of tennis-parental stressor: competition, coaches, finance, time, siblings, organization-related, and developmental. Parents experienced a diverse number of competitive stressors indicating the particular difficulties they faced before, during, and after matches involving their child, opponents, other parents, and officials. They also reported a wide range of organizational stressors that paralleled the financial, social, and personal investments that accompanied their support roles. The results of this research reinforce the importance of parents possessing the necessary skills to cope with the psychological, developmental, and logistical demands of competitive tennis. Implications with respect to induction workshops and education for coaches and parents are presented, as well as consideration for governing bodies to enhance their communication channels and logistical support. Future research recommendations are posed to build upon the study of this domain in youth sport.

AB The paddle-tennis is a very popular sport, which has become in recent decades a sport of great global projection. This increased volume of play, combined with the physical demands of racquet sports, leading to injuries of the musculoskeletal system, both excessive and repetitive use of gestures as direct trauma. In this study we have surveyed 404 active paddle-tennis players of all levels; 310 men and 94 women with mean age 38 years +/- 9. 8 years (14 years-66 years). 67.8% of the participants have suffered an injury: 40% in the upper extremity, 40% in the lower extremities and 20% in the back. 53. 5% of participants were federated, 81.2% were right-hand and 23.5% were considered novice, 53% in medium level, 20. 8% in high level and 2. 7% in professional level. Finally, according to the IPAQ questionnaire, the 82. 5% of the sample performed severe activity during the week; 15% moderate and the slight rest.
   The main predictors were injured: players older than 34 years, with more than 69 kg, more than 26. 17 kg/m(2)of BMI, to play backhand and be right; at an intermediate level and an experience of 20 years or less. The results affirm us that there are not as marked differences between injuries that occur on the paddle tennis players, regarding tennis players, since specific demands on the musculoskeletal system generate own racquet sport pathologies, emphasizing the Achilles tendon injury and knee sprain main acute injuries; with epicondylitis, the subacromial syndrome and low back pain and chronic injuries.

TI Tournament Structure and Success of Players Based on Location in Men's
   Professional Tennis
SO JOURNAL OF SPORTS SCIENCE AND MEDICINE
AB This article discusses the relationship between success of professional male tennis players according to the country and world region from which they originate and the professional tournament structure in men's tennis in that world region and country. The success of a country or world region was defined by the number of players in the top 300 ATP rankings and was calculated for seven time periods between 1975 and 2008. The results showed the correlations between the total number of top 300 ranked players, the total number of tournaments, and the annual tournament prize money of the specific country. The correlations were nearly perfect in the 1975-1990 period (r = 0.93-0.95; p < 0.01) but only high in the 2005-2008 period (r = 0.60-0.64; p < 0.01), suggesting that the association between the number of top 300 ranked tennis players and professional tournaments, while still significant, is in decline. These data should inform the policy and investment decisions of regional and national federations, particularly as they relate to domestic professional tennis tournament structures and to explore opportunities to include professional tournaments of neighbour countries in their player's development programs.
